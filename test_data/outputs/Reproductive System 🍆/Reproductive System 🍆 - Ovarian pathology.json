                        "question": "How do mixed germ cell tumors of the ovary differ from pure germ cell tumors in terms of histology and clinical behavior?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Mixed germ cell tumors contain more than one type of germ cell tumor component (e.g., dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma), and their behavior is often dictated by the most aggressive component present.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Mixed germ cell tumors are characterized by a combination of germ cell and epithelial components, representing a transitional form between epithelial and germ cell ovarian neoplasms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Mixed germ cell tumors are defined by the presence of both benign and malignant germ cell elements within the same tumor, with an overall benign clinical course.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mixed germ cell tumors are typically bilateral and uniformly aggressive, regardless of the specific germ cell components, requiring more intensive chemotherapy protocols.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Mixed germ cell tumors are composed of germ cells intermixed with sex cord-stromal elements, blurring the distinction between these two major categories of ovarian tumors."

                        "question": "Which type of sex cord-stromal tumor of the ovary is most commonly associated with virilization in premenopausal women?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are the sex cord-stromal tumors most frequently associated with androgen production, leading to virilization in premenopausal women.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Granulosa cell tumors are primarily associated with virilization due to their androgen-producing capacity, causing hirsutism and voice deepening.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Fibrothecomas are commonly linked to virilization because of their stromal cell origin and potential for androgen synthesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Steroid cell tumors, not otherwise specified, are rarely associated with virilization, typically producing estrogen and causing feminizing effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gonadoblastomas are the most common cause of virilization in women with Y chromosome material, but are not strictly classified as sex cord-stromal tumors in all classifications."

                        "question": "What are the most common primary malignancies that metastasize to the ovary, and what is the typical pattern of metastatic spread?",
                        "goodAnswer": "The most common primary malignancies metastasizing to the ovary are carcinomas of the colon, stomach, breast, and endometrium, typically spreading via direct extension, lymphatic, or hematogenous routes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Metastatic tumors to the ovary most frequently originate from lung cancer and melanoma, spreading primarily through transcoelomic dissemination across peritoneal surfaces.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Ovarian metastases are predominantly from hematologic malignancies like lymphoma and leukemia, infiltrating the ovary through systemic circulation and bone marrow involvement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The most common primary sites for ovarian metastases are cervical and vulvar cancers, spreading via direct pelvic extension and regional lymph node involvement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Metastatic tumors to the ovary typically arise from primary brain tumors and sarcomas, spreading through cerebrospinal fluid pathways and direct invasion from adjacent structures."
