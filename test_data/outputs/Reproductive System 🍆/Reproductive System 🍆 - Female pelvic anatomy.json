                        "goodAnswer": "The endometrium, the innermost layer, is highly responsive to hormonal changes, leading to its cyclical regeneration and desquamation during menstruation under estrogen and progesterone influence.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The myometrium, the middle layer, is composed of smooth muscle and exhibits significant changes in thickness and contractility, directly shedding during the menstrual phase due to hormonal withdrawal.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The perimetrium, the outermost serosal layer, directly interacts with hormonal signals to initiate the proliferative phase of the endometrial lining and is shed along with the functional layer.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The basalis layer, the deepest part of the endometrium, shows the most pronounced cyclic changes and is fully shed during menstruation, while the functionalis remains to regenerate.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The stratum functionalis, a component of the myometrium, is shed monthly under the influence of estrogen withdrawal, regenerating from the stratum basalis of the myometrium."

                        "question": "What is the primary role of the myometrium during parturition and what hormonal influence most directly facilitates this function?",
                        "goodAnswer": "The myometrium's primary role is to facilitate uterine contractions during labor, a process primarily stimulated and coordinated by oxytocin released from the posterior pituitary gland, enhancing contractility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The myometrium supports implantation by providing a stable foundation for the developing embryo, a function heavily reliant on progesterone produced by the corpus luteum, which also induces myometrial relaxation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The myometrium contributes to cervical dilation during labor through enzymatic degradation of collagen, regulated predominantly by relaxin secreted by the ovaries, softening the myometrial tissue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The myometrium plays a crucial role in sperm transport by generating peristaltic waves, a process mainly driven by estrogen secreted by the developing follicles, increasing myometrial excitability.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The myometrium prevents uterine prolapse by maintaining tonic contraction, influenced by continuous release of follicle-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary, tonifying the smooth muscle."

                        "goodAnswer": "The primary arterial supply is from the uterine artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, which branches into arcuate arteries that encircle the uterus, further branching into radial arteries penetrating the myometrium and endometrium.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The uterine blood supply originates primarily from the ovarian artery, branching directly into spiral arteries that supply the endometrium and arcuate arteries that supply the myometrium, bypassing the uterine artery.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The external iliac artery gives rise to the uterine artery, which directly supplies the basalis layer of the endometrium and forms a network of capillary beds within the myometrium, without forming arcuate arteries.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The uterine artery, stemming from the common iliac artery, initially forms radial arteries in the myometrium, which then give rise to arcuate arteries located in the endometrium, reversing the branching order.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Venous drainage of the uterus is primarily via the uterine vein, which directly empties into the inferior vena cava, bypassing the iliac veins entirely, and arterial supply comes from external iliac artery."

                        "goodAnswer": "The myometrium is the thick middle layer of the uterus, primarily composed of smooth muscle fibers arranged in multiple directions, enabling powerful uterine contractions during childbirth and menstruation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The endometrium, the inner mucosal layer, contains a significant proportion of smooth muscle, which facilitates the shedding of the functional layer during menstruation and contributes to uterine contractility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The perimetrium, the outer serosal layer, includes a thin layer of smooth muscle that contributes to overall uterine tone and support within the pelvic cavity, and is the primary contractile layer.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The parametrium, the connective tissue surrounding the uterus, is rich in smooth muscle, extending from the cervix and supporting the lower uterine segment during pregnancy and labor contractions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The stratum basalis, a deep layer of the endometrium, is predominantly smooth muscle and regenerates the stratum functionalis after menstruation, also contributing to uterine contractions."

                        "goodAnswer": "In the proliferative phase, the endometrial stroma is cellular and composed primarily of spindle-shaped stromal cells, along with a sparse extracellular matrix containing reticular fibers and developing blood vessels, under estrogen influence.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "During the proliferative phase, the endometrial stroma is dense and fibrous, characterized by abundant collagen fibers and few stromal cells, providing structural support to the endometrium under progesterone influence.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The stroma in the proliferative phase is edematous and loosely arranged, dominated by leukocytes and macrophages in preparation for potential implantation during the secretory phase, not the proliferative.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In the proliferative phase, the endometrial stroma is acellular and gelatinous, composed mainly of hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans, facilitating rapid endometrial growth but lacking cellular components.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The proliferative stroma is characterized by decidualized cells with large, polygonal shapes and glycogen-rich cytoplasm, indicating preparation for implantation, a feature of the secretory phase not proliferative."
