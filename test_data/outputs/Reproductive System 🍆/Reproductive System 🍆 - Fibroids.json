                        "goodAnswer": "Key considerations include patient's desire for future fertility, number, size, and location of fibroids, severity of symptoms, patient age, and risk of recurrence; myomectomy is uterus-sparing, while hysterectomy is definitive but eliminates fertility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The primary factor in choosing between myomectomy and hysterectomy is the patient's body mass index (BMI); myomectomy is preferred for obese women due to lower surgical complexity, while hysterectomy is indicated for women with normal BMI.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The main determinant is the patient's insurance coverage; myomectomy is generally more cost-effective and covered by most insurance plans, whereas hysterectomy is reserved for patients with comprehensive healthcare coverage.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The crucial factor is the patient's menopausal status; myomectomy is indicated for perimenopausal women to preserve ovarian function, while hysterectomy is the preferred option for women who have completed childbearing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The deciding factor is the patient's preference for minimally invasive surgery; myomectomy is always performed laparoscopically or robotically, while hysterectomy is typically performed via open laparotomy for optimal surgical outcomes."
