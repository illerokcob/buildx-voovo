                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Stimulating nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity within the endothelium of penile arteries, increasing nitric oxide (NO) production and directly causing smooth muscle contraction in the corpus cavernosum, leading to enhanced venous outflow restriction and thus maintaining penile rigidity and erection duration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors located in the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa, preventing norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction and promoting arterial vasodilation, thereby directly inducing penile erection even in the absence of sexual stimuli and NO signaling pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Increasing systemic testosterone levels in the bloodstream by directly stimulating Leydig cells in the testes, enhancing libido and sexual desire, and indirectly stimulating smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus spongiosum, primarily affecting penile tumescence rather than rigidity of corpora cavernosa.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Activating guanylate cyclase, an enzyme that directly converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic GMP (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the penis, independent of nitric oxide signaling pathways and parasympathetic nervous system activation, thus directly inducing erection without sexual stimulation."

                        "goodAnswer": "Orgasm phase, characterized by intense pleasurable sensations, rhythmic contractions of pelvic floor muscles, and physiological release of neuromuscular tension, culminating in the expulsion of semen through ejaculation and concurrent psychological peak experience.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Excitement phase, marked by initial physiological responses such as vasocongestion of penile tissues leading to tumescence, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and early stages of myotonia, directly transitioning into ejaculation without a distinct plateau phase.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Plateau phase, a period of sustained and heightened sexual arousal with further increases in vasocongestion, heart rate, and muscle tension, immediately followed by resolution phase characterized by physiological return to baseline without orgasm or ejaculation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Resolution phase, characterized by return to baseline physiological state of cardiovascular and muscular systems, decreased vasocongestion, and sense of relaxation, occurring right before the onset of ejaculation and preceding any phase of heightened sexual arousal or orgasm.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Refractory phase, a period of physiological sexual unresponsiveness following orgasm and ejaculation, during which further stimulation does not readily lead to arousal or erection, typically occurring just prior to ejaculation and orgasm as a protective mechanism against premature expulsion."
