                        "question": "In the management of preeclampsia, under what specific maternal or fetal conditions is immediate delivery generally indicated, regardless of gestational age, to prioritize maternal and fetal well-being?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Immediate delivery is generally indicated in preeclampsia with severe features, such as uncontrolled severe hypertension, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, persistent non-reassuring fetal status, or acute kidney injury, irrespective of gestational age.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Immediate delivery is indicated in all cases of preeclampsia diagnosed after 37 weeks of gestation, regardless of maternal or fetal condition severity, primarily to prevent post-term pregnancy complications and optimize neonatal outcomes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Immediate delivery is only indicated in preeclampsia with mild features if gestational age is less than 24 weeks, as expectant management and close monitoring are preferred for pregnancies beyond this gestational age threshold.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Immediate delivery is indicated in preeclampsia solely based on maternal request for delivery, irrespective of clinical severity or gestational age, to respect patient autonomy and preferences in pregnancy management decisions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Immediate delivery is only indicated in preeclampsia if fetal lung maturity is confirmed via amniocentesis, regardless of maternal condition severity or gestational age, to minimize the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome."
