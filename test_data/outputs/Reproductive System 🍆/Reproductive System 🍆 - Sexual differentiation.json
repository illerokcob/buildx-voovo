                        "goodAnswer": "The SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the Testis-Determining Factor (TDF), a protein that initiates the development of the bipotential gonad into a testis by upregulating SOX9 and activating downstream genes responsible for Sertoli and Leydig cell differentiation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The SRY gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the Ovarian-Determining Factor (ODF), a protein that suppresses testicular development and promotes ovarian differentiation in the bipotential gonad through activation of FOXL2 and WNT4.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The SRY gene, located on an autosome, encodes the Gonadal-Determining Factor (GDF), a protein that is essential for the initial formation of the bipotential gonad from the intermediate mesoderm but does not directly influence sex-specific differentiation pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the Mullerian-Inhibiting Factor (MIF), a hormone that causes the regression of the Mullerian ducts and thereby prevents the formation of female reproductive structures in males independently of gonadal differentiation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF1), a transcription factor that regulates the production of steroid hormones in the adrenal glands and gonads but is not directly involved in the initial steps of bipotential gonad differentiation into testes."

                        "goodAnswer": "In the absence of SRY and its product TDF, the bipotential gonad defaults to ovarian development, influenced by the activation of genes such as WNT4 and FOXL2, leading to the differentiation of granulosa and theca cells and formation of ovarian follicles.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad undergoes spontaneous regression due to lack of promoting signals, leading to gonadal dysgenesis and the absence of both ovarian and testicular tissue, resulting in a sexually undifferentiated phenotype and hormonal deficiencies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad is actively redirected towards testicular development due to the unopposed action of autosomal genes like SOX9 that are constitutively expressed and promote male differentiation in all genetic backgrounds unless actively suppressed.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad develops into an ovotestis, containing both ovarian and testicular tissue, due to the lack of a definitive signal to specify either male or female fate, resulting in a mixed gonadal phenotype and ambiguous genitalia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad develops into adrenal cortical tissue, producing high levels of adrenal androgens which drive the development of ambiguous genitalia in a female direction, mimicking congenital adrenal hyperplasia in 46,XX individuals."

                        "goodAnswer": "AMH, a glycoprotein hormone secreted by Sertoli cells in the developing testes from around week 7 of gestation, acts on mesenchymal cells surrounding the Mullerian ducts to induce their apoptosis, preventing the formation of uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina in males.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "AMH, secreted by Leydig cells in the developing testes starting from week 12 of gestation, stimulates the differentiation of the Wolffian ducts into the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles by paracrine signaling, essential for the development of the male reproductive tract.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "AMH, secreted by granulosa cells of the developing ovaries after week 10 of gestation, promotes the development of the Mullerian ducts into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina in females, while simultaneously suppressing the development of the Wolffian duct structures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "AMH, secreted by the adrenal glands under the influence of ACTH, suppresses the production of androgens in the testes and ovaries, ensuring proper sexual differentiation based on chromosomal sex, regardless of initial gonadal differentiation status.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "AMH, secreted by the pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic GnRH, regulates the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn control gonadal steroidogenesis and germ cell maturation in both sexes but has no direct role in ductal differentiation."

                        "goodAnswer": "Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen converted from testosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase type 2 in the genital skin and urogenital sinus, is primarily responsible for the development of the penis, scrotum, and prostate from the external genital tubercle and urogenital folds.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Testosterone, the main androgen produced by Leydig cells in the testes, directly mediates the virilization of the external genitalia by binding to androgen receptors in the genital tubercle and initiating male phenotypic development without requiring local conversion to DHT.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Estradiol, an estrogen produced by the placenta and fetal ovaries, is converted to DHT in target tissues by aromatase and is the primary hormone responsible for the masculinization of the external genitalia and the sexual differentiation of the brain during fetal development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Androstenedione, an adrenal androgen precursor, is converted to DHT in peripheral tissues by 5-alpha-reductase type 1 and plays a crucial role in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, but has a minimal role in fetal virilization of external genitalia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Cortisol, a glucocorticoid produced by the adrenal glands, is converted to DHT in the genital skin by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and acts synergistically with testosterone to induce the development of male external genitalia during fetal life, enhancing androgen receptor sensitivity."

                        "goodAnswer": "Deletion syndromes, like WAGR, are caused by the loss of a contiguous segment of a chromosome, often involving multiple genes within the deleted region, leading to a complex phenotype that can include disruption of genes essential for gonadal development and hormonal regulation, resulting in various intersex conditions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Deletion syndromes are primarily caused by point mutations in single, critical genes that are essential for sexual differentiation, such as mutations in the SRY gene or genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, leading to highly specific hormonal imbalances and phenotypes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Deletion syndromes are commonly caused by trisomy of sex chromosomes, such as XXY or XXX, resulting in an imbalance of sex chromosome dosage and subsequent disruptions in sexual development and fertility, but not typically associated with loss of genetic material.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Deletion syndromes are exclusively caused by uniparental disomy, where an individual inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other, leading to imprinting disorders and altered gene expression of specific imprinted genes, affecting sexual development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Deletion syndromes in the context of sexual differentiation are primarily caused by epigenetic modifications, such as global DNA methylation or histone deacetylation, that broadly silence or activate large sets of genes involved in sexual development, resulting in variable expressivity and penetrance of phenotypes."

                        "goodAnswer": "Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS) is the hallmark of MIS deficiency in 46,XY males, characterized by the retention of Mullerian duct derivatives (uterus and fallopian tubes) alongside otherwise normal male internal (Wolffian ducts) and external genitalia, often discovered incidentally during surgery for cryptorchidism or inguinal hernia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) is the typical presentation of MIS deficiency in 46,XY males, resulting in a female phenotype externally and internally, despite the presence of testes and MIS deficiency, due to complete unresponsiveness to androgens and secondary failure of Mullerian duct regression.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common outcome of MIS deficiency in 46,XY males, leading to virilization of external genitalia in males and adrenal insufficiency due to the enzymatic block in cortisol biosynthesis, indirectly affecting Mullerian duct regression.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "5-alpha-reductase deficiency is frequently associated with MIS deficiency in 46,XY males, resulting in ambiguous genitalia at birth and virilization at puberty due to impaired DHT production, and a secondary effect on Mullerian duct development leading to PMDS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gonadal dysgenesis is a common consequence of MIS deficiency in 46,XY males, leading to streak gonads and failure of testicular development due to the lack of Sertoli cell function which also produces MIS, resulting in a female phenotype and absence of Mullerian structures."

                        "goodAnswer": "17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency impairs the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone in the testes and peripheral tissues, leading to reduced testosterone production and virilization in 46,XY individuals, resulting in ambiguous genitalia at birth with predominantly female external appearance and undescended testes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency affects the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in the adrenal glands and gonads, leading to a global deficiency in all steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and corticosteroids, resulting in severe adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia in both sexes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency impairs the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in target tissues, leading to reduced DHT levels and incomplete virilization of external genitalia in 46,XY individuals, characterized by micropenis and hypospadias but normal testicular testosterone levels.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency affects the conversion of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone in the adrenal cortex, leading to mineralocorticoid deficiency and salt-wasting crisis in neonates, but does not directly impact androgen biosynthesis or sexual differentiation in 46,XY individuals.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency impairs the conversion of cortisol to cortisone in the liver and kidneys, leading to altered glucocorticoid metabolism and potential Cushing's syndrome-like features, with secondary effects on androgen production and mild virilization defects in 46,XY newborns."

                        "goodAnswer": "AIS is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome (Xq12), resulting in a non-functional or partially functional androgen receptor protein that cannot effectively bind and respond to androgens, and it follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, primarily affecting 46,XY individuals.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "AIS is caused by defects in the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to reduced DHT production and impaired androgen action in DHT-dependent tissues, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, affecting both 46,XY and 46,XX individuals similarly.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "AIS is caused by deficiencies in steroidogenic enzymes, such as 21-hydroxylase or 11-beta-hydroxylase, leading to adrenal androgen excess and compensatory suppression of testicular androgen production, and it follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, primarily affecting 46,XX individuals with virilization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "AIS is caused by mutations in the genes encoding for coactivators or corepressors of steroid hormone receptors, leading to generalized resistance to all steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and corticosteroids, and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, affecting both sexes equally.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "AIS is caused by defects in the transport proteins that carry androgens in the bloodstream, such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to reduced bioavailability of androgens to target tissues, and it is inherited in a Y-linked manner, exclusively affecting 46,XY individuals with variable androgen sensitivity."

                        "goodAnswer": "Individuals with CAIS typically have a 46,XY karyotype and present at birth with a completely female phenotype, including female external genitalia and vagina; at puberty, they develop female secondary sexual characteristics (breasts) due to estrogen conversion from androgens, but lack pubic and axillary hair, and have intra-abdominal or inguinal testes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Individuals with CAIS typically have a 46,XX karyotype and present at birth with ambiguous genitalia, including clitoromegaly and labial fusion, due to exposure to excess androgens from maternal or adrenal sources; at puberty, they virilize further with deepening of voice and male-pattern baldness, but develop ovaries and female internal genitalia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Individuals with CAIS typically have a 45,X karyotype (Turner syndrome) and present at birth with streak gonads and female phenotype, but also with short stature and other features of Turner syndrome, unrelated to androgen insensitivity; puberty is typically delayed and requires hormone replacement therapy for development of secondary sexual characteristics.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Individuals with CAIS typically have a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) and present at birth with male phenotype but with small testes and gynecomastia, due to the presence of an extra X chromosome and androgen insensitivity; puberty is marked by further gynecomastia and testicular atrophy, with reduced virilization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Individuals with CAIS typically have a 46,XY karyotype and present at birth with a fully virilized male phenotype, but develop androgen insensitivity later in life, leading to infertility and gynecomastia at puberty due to acquired resistance to androgens and paradoxical estrogen effects from testosterone conversion."

                        "wrongAnswer_2": "True hermaphroditism is characterized by the presence of only testicular tissue in an individual with a 46,XX karyotype, resulting in a male phenotype despite having female chromosomes and absence of SRY gene, and is caused by translocation of SRY to an X chromosome.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "True hermaphroditism is defined by the absence of both ovarian and testicular tissue, leading to streak gonads and a complete lack of sex hormone production in an individual with any karyotype, and is more accurately termed gonadal dysgenesis or agenesis.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The most frequent cause of 46,XX males is the translocation of the SRY gene from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome (or rarely to an autosome) during paternal meiosis, resulting in an XX individual who inherits the male-determining SRY gene and subsequently develops testes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Sex reversal in 46,XX males is typically caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SOX9 gene, leading to its constitutive activation in the absence of SRY and subsequent testicular development in an XX genetic background through an SRY-independent pathway.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Sex reversal in 46,XX males is predominantly due to androgen receptor gain-of-function mutations, causing hypersensitivity to endogenous androgens and phenotypic masculinization in the presence of female chromosomes and absence of testicular development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Sex reversal in 46,XX males is commonly associated with maternal exposure to high levels of exogenous androgens during pregnancy, leading to virilization of female fetuses and male phenotypic development despite the absence of SRY and testicular tissue.",

                        "goodAnswer": "In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone causes accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is shunted into adrenal androgen synthesis pathways, leading to excess androgens like androstenedione and testosterone, causing prenatal virilization of female genitalia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the primary hormonal imbalance is an overproduction of cortisol due to feedback dysregulation, leading to Cushingoid features and virilization in 46,XX females through glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathways that directly stimulate androgen production in the adrenal cortex.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the impaired synthesis of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone leads to salt-wasting and hypotension, but does not directly contribute to virilization in 46,XX females; virilization is primarily due to a separate, concurrent defect in estrogen biosynthesis in the adrenal glands.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the primary hormonal defect is estrogen deficiency due to impaired aromatase activity in the adrenal glands, leading to virilization in 46,XX females because of the relative excess of adrenal androgens compared to the deficient levels of estrogens, creating a hormonal imbalance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the impaired conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone leads to a global deficiency in all steroid hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroids, resulting in adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia in both sexes due to the lack of all downstream steroid products, not specifically androgen excess."

                        "question": "Which imaging modality is typically considered the most informative and comprehensive for evaluating internal pelvic anatomy, specifically the presence and morphology of uterus, ovaries, testes, and Mullerian/Wolffian duct derivatives, in individuals with intersex disorders?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), particularly with high-resolution sequences and contrast enhancement, is often considered the most informative imaging modality for detailed visualization of internal pelvic organs, including uterus, ovaries, testes, and Mullerian and Wolffian duct derivatives, providing superior soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail crucial for diagnosis and surgical planning in intersex disorders.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Pelvic X-ray, including contrast studies like genitography, is the most informative imaging modality for evaluating internal pelvic anatomy in intersex disorders, as it provides high-resolution images of bony structures, calcifications, and outlines of contrast-filled cavities like the vagina and urethra, but limited soft tissue detail regarding gonads and ductal structures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Pelvic Computed Tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast is the most informative imaging modality for evaluating internal pelvic anatomy in intersex disorders, as it provides rapid and comprehensive volumetric imaging with excellent soft tissue contrast and multiplanar reconstructions, useful for visualizing gonads and large pelvic structures, but with ionizing radiation exposure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Pelvic Ultrasound, especially transabdominal and endorectal/endovaginal approaches, is the most informative imaging modality for evaluating internal pelvic anatomy in intersex disorders, as it is non-invasive, readily available, and provides real-time imaging of pelvic structures, particularly useful for initial assessment and follow-up of gonadal and uterine morphology in pediatric patients.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Diagnostic Laparoscopy with pelvic exploration is the most informative imaging modality for evaluating internal pelvic anatomy in intersex disorders, as it allows direct visualization of pelvic organs and enables tissue biopsies for histological analysis and gonadal assessment, but is an invasive surgical procedure typically reserved for specific diagnostic uncertainties or surgical interventions."
