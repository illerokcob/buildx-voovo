                        "goodAnswer": "Elevated LH levels in PCOS often stimulate the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, contributing to hyperandrogenism, even if some presentations might seem to suggest hypoandrogenism due to specific androgen profiles.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Increased LH levels directly suppress ovarian androgen production, leading to hypoandrogenism and subsequently causing oligo- or anovulation through reduced estrogen conversion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "LH levels are generally decreased in PCOS, which indirectly causes an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to premature ovarian failure and anovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "LH fluctuations are normalized in PCOS, but the increased sensitivity of granulosa cells to LH leads to excessive estrogen production and a negative feedback loop that inhibits ovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "LH primarily acts on the adrenal glands in PCOS, causing them to secrete excessive androgens, while ovarian function remains largely unaffected by LH levels."

                        "goodAnswer": "Hyperandrogenism in PCOS can disrupt normal follicular development and maturation, leading to oligo- or anovulation by interfering with the delicate hormonal balance required for ovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hypoandrogenism directly stimulates excessive follicular development, resulting in multiple immature follicles and subsequent oligo- or anovulation due to follicular burnout.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "While androgen levels are unrelated to ovulation, the primary cause of oligo- or anovulation in PCOS is the overproduction of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Oligo- or anovulation in PCOS is primarily driven by elevated estrogen levels, which suppress LH and FSH, preventing proper follicular maturation and ovulation regardless of androgen status.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Normal androgen levels in PCOS cause a direct blockage of the fallopian tubes, physically preventing ovulation and leading to infertility, which is then categorized as anovulation."

                        "goodAnswer": "An elevated LH to FSH ratio, common in PCOS, preferentially stimulates androgen production by the ovaries over estrogen production, contributing to hyperandrogenism and disrupting follicular maturation necessary for ovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "A decreased LH to FSH ratio in PCOS leads to increased aromatase activity in granulosa cells, resulting in excessive estrogen production and subsequent suppression of androgen synthesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The LH to FSH ratio remains unchanged in PCOS; however, increased sensitivity of ovarian receptors to both LH and FSH causes a generalized overstimulation of ovarian hormone production, primarily estrogen.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In PCOS, a reversed LH to FSH ratio (FSH higher than LH) directly inhibits theca cell function, leading to hypoandrogenism and a subsequent lack of estrogen, causing anovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The LH to FSH ratio is only relevant in diagnosing PCOS but has no direct impact on the hormonal imbalances or the mechanisms leading to oligo- or anovulation observed in the condition."

                        "question": "How does hyperinsulinaemia, frequently observed in PCOS, contribute to ovarian hyperandrogenism at the cellular level?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Elevated insulin levels in PCOS can enhance ovarian theca cell sensitivity to LH, augmenting androgen production, and also reduce hepatic production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), increasing free androgen bioavailability.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hyperinsulinaemia directly stimulates ovarian granulosa cell proliferation, leading to increased estrogen production, which then indirectly increases androgen production as a precursor.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Increased insulin levels in PCOS primarily affect the adrenal glands, causing them to secrete excess androgens, while the ovarian androgen production remains largely unaffected by insulin.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Hyperinsulinaemia reduces the sensitivity of ovarian theca cells to LH, paradoxically leading to increased androgen production as a compensatory mechanism due to impaired estrogen synthesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Elevated insulin levels in PCOS promote the conversion of androgens to estrogens within the ovarian follicles, thus contributing to hyperandrogenism by increasing the overall pool of sex hormones."

                        "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which insulin resistance in PCOS contributes to the development of hyperinsulinaemia?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Insulin resistance reduces the effectiveness of insulin in peripheral tissues, necessitating increased insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells to maintain glucose homeostasis, leading to hyperinsulinaemia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Insulin resistance directly stimulates hepatic glucose production, causing hyperglycaemia, which in turn triggers increased insulin secretion as a secondary response, leading to hyperinsulinaemia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Insulin resistance impairs insulin clearance by the liver, resulting in the accumulation of insulin in the bloodstream and thus causing hyperinsulinaemia independent of pancreatic secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Insulin resistance increases the sensitivity of pancreatic beta cells to glucose, causing them to overproduce insulin even at normal glucose levels, directly resulting in hyperinsulinaemia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Insulin resistance reduces glucose uptake by pancreatic beta cells, leading to a compensatory increase in insulin production to overcome the reduced cellular energy, resulting in hyperinsulinaemia."

                        "goodAnswer": "Impaired insulin receptor signalling, often involving defects in post-receptor pathways such as IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt activation, is a key mechanism in PCOS-related insulin resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Increased expression of insulin receptors on cell surfaces leads to receptor desensitization and reduced downstream signaling, resulting in insulin resistance in PCOS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Enhanced glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation to the cell membrane, despite the presence of insulin, paradoxically reduces cellular glucose uptake, causing insulin resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) promotes excessive glycogen synthesis, depleting intracellular glucose and mimicking a state of glucose deprivation, thus causing insulin resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Elevated levels of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing hormone, in PCOS directly interfere with insulin signaling pathways, leading to a state of insulin resistance as a feedback mechanism."

                        "goodAnswer": "Insulin, in addition to its metabolic effects, also acts as a growth factor that can stimulate ovarian steroidogenesis, particularly androgen production, and influence reproductive functions, relevant in PCOS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Insulin primarily functions as an anti-inflammatory agent and its actions in reducing inflammation are crucial in mitigating the symptoms of PCOS, though not directly related to its pathophysiology.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Insulin's main role outside glucose metabolism is to regulate blood pressure, and its dysregulation in PCOS contributes to hypertension, a common comorbidity, but not directly to PCOS etiology.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Insulin is involved in bone density regulation, and its deficiency in PCOS leads to osteoporosis, which is a significant, albeit indirect, consequence of insulin resistance in PCOS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Insulin's secondary action is to promote muscle protein synthesis, and its resistance in PCOS leads to muscle wasting, which exacerbates metabolic dysfunction but is not central to PCOS pathophysiology."
