                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Pregnancy invariably causes complete regression and disappearance of pre-existing genital warts due to hormonal shifts that are intrinsically antiviral in nature and promote robust cell-mediated immunity against HPV.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Vertical transmission risk exists, though relatively low, estimated at less than 1% for most HPV types, and can lead to neonatal HPV infection, potentially manifesting as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (laryngeal papillomatosis) or genital warts in the newborn, particularly if maternal infection is active at delivery.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Vertical transmission of HPV from mother to newborn is inevitable and universally results in severe, life-threatening congenital HPV-related diseases in all infants delivered vaginally to HPV-positive mothers.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Vertical transmission of HPV is impossible due to placental barrier protection and neonatal innate immunity, ensuring newborns are always HPV-free regardless of maternal infection status or delivery route.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Vertical transmission of HPV leads exclusively to maternal HPV eradication postpartum via a neonatal immune-mediated clearance mechanism, acting as a natural form of immunotherapy for the mother but causing severe neonatal morbidity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Vertical transmission of HPV only occurs in cases of cesarean section deliveries due to surgical inoculation, while vaginal deliveries completely eliminate the risk of neonatal HPV infection through natural vaginal flora protection."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Management of genital warts in pregnancy mandates systemic antiviral chemotherapy with high-dose acyclovir administered intravenously throughout gestation, regardless of wart size or location, to prevent vertical transmission and fetal HPV infection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Surgical excision of all genital warts is the gold standard management in pregnancy, performed electively in the first trimester under general anesthesia to completely eliminate any risk of vertical transmission and maternal discomfort.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Management of genital warts in pregnancy is strictly contraindicated, as any intervention, including topical treatments, poses a greater risk to the fetus than leaving the warts untreated until postpartum, ensuring fetal safety above maternal symptomatic relief.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Radiation therapy, specifically brachytherapy, is the preferred treatment modality for genital warts in pregnant women, as it effectively eradicates HPV in situ without systemic fetal exposure or risk of vertical transmission, ensuring targeted treatment and fetal protection."

                        "goodAnswer": "Condyloma lata are typically broader, flatter, moist, smooth-surfaced, and often found in intertriginous areas and mucous membranes, while condyloma acuminata are usually pedunculated, exophytic, cauliflower-like, and less frequently in intertriginous zones, with serological testing for syphilis being crucial for differentiation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Condyloma lata and condyloma acuminata are clinically indistinguishable and can only be differentiated through advanced genetic analysis of lesion tissue samples using techniques like polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Condyloma lata are intensely painful, ulcerated lesions with purulent discharge and systemic inflammatory signs, whereas condyloma acuminata are invariably asymptomatic and non-inflammatory throughout their clinical course.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Condyloma lata are characterized by their rapid growth, aggressive invasion of surrounding tissues, and propensity for distant metastasis, while condyloma acuminata are always benign, slow-growing, and localized to the site of infection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Condyloma lata are exclusively found on mucosal surfaces like the oral cavity, nasal mucosa, and conjunctiva, whereas condyloma acuminata are limited to keratinized skin areas such as palms, soles, and non-mucosal genital skin."

                        "question": "What role does HPV typing play in the diagnosis and subsequent clinical management of genital warts, considering its utility and limitations in routine clinical practice?",
                        "goodAnswer": "HPV typing is not routinely needed for typical genital warts as management is based on lesion removal, but may be used in atypical presentations, for research, in cases of persistent infection, dysplasia, or immunocompromised patients to identify high-risk types and guide further management and screening strategies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "HPV typing is mandatory for all cases of suspected genital warts and is the primary determinant of treatment modality, prognosis, and risk stratification in every patient, guiding antiviral therapy and long-term follow-up protocols.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "HPV typing is clinically irrelevant in genital wart management and is only performed for epidemiological studies, public health surveillance purposes, and tracking HPV prevalence in population-based surveys.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "HPV typing is exclusively used to predict the risk of developing systemic autoimmune diseases and has no bearing on the management of genital warts themselves or the risk of HPV-related malignancies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "HPV typing is essential for determining the contagiousness of genital warts and for implementing mandatory quarantine measures and contact tracing protocols to prevent further spread of HPV infection within communities and healthcare settings."
