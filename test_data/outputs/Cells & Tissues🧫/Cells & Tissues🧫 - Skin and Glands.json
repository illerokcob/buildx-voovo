                        "goodAnswer": "Prolactin, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, is the principal hormone driving milk synthesis in lactocytes, promoting alveolar development and milk component production throughout lactation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Estrogen, primarily produced by the ovaries, is essential for mammary gland ductal development during puberty and pregnancy, but has a lesser direct role in stimulating milk secretion post-partum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum and placenta, mainly contributes to alveolar development during pregnancy, but its levels decline post-partum, indirectly influencing milk production.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Oxytocin, released from the posterior pituitary gland, primarily triggers milk ejection (let-down reflex) by causing contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding alveoli, rather than directly stimulating milk synthesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal cortex, plays a role in mammary gland development and differentiation, but its primary function in lactation is more related to stress response and metabolic regulation rather than direct milk stimulation."
