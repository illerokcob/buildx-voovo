                        "goodAnswer": "Chondrocytes in lacunae maintain the cartilaginous matrix, which is rich in type II collagen and proteoglycans, providing resilience and smooth, low-friction surfaces for joint movement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Chondrocytes in lacunae produce abundant elastic fibers that are embedded in the matrix, allowing hyaline cartilage to withstand repeated bending and stretching forces.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Chondrocytes in lacunae secrete a highly vascularized matrix containing calcium salts, providing rigidity and structural support characteristic of bone tissue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Chondrocytes in lacunae are connected by gap junctions, facilitating rapid diffusion of nutrients and waste products throughout the avascular cartilaginous matrix.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Chondrocytes in lacunae differentiate into osteoblasts, contributing to the process of endochondral ossification and the replacement of cartilage by bone during development."
