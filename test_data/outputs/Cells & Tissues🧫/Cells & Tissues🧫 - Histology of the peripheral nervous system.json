                        "goodAnswer": "Signal termination at a cholinergic synapse is primarily mediated by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme residing in the synaptic cleft that rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh) into acetate and choline, effectively reducing ACh concentration and terminating receptor activation; choline is then actively reuptaken by the presynaptic terminal via a specific transporter for ACh resynthesis, while acetate diffuses away.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Signal termination at a cholinergic synapse is achieved by the active transport of intact acetylcholine (ACh) molecules back into the presynaptic neuron via vesicular transporters, directly removing ACh from the synaptic cleft and terminating the signal; acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays no significant role in this process but is involved in ACh synthesis within the presynaptic terminal.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Signal termination at a cholinergic synapse occurs primarily through the passive diffusion of acetylcholine (ACh) away from the synaptic cleft into the surrounding extracellular fluid, where it is subsequently metabolized by non-specific esterases; reuptake mechanisms and acetylcholinesterase are not involved in this process.",
