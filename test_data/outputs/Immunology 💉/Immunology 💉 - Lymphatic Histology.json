                        "goodAnswer": "Lymphocyte homing is the highly regulated and directed migration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into specific tissues, including secondary lymphoid organs and peripheral sites of inflammation, ensuring that immune cells are strategically positioned to efficiently encounter antigens, interact with antigen-presenting cells, and mount appropriate and localized immune responses, tailored to the specific threat and location.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Lymphocyte homing refers to the random and non-specific circulation of lymphocytes throughout the entire bloodstream, allowing them to encounter antigens by chance and initiate immune responses anywhere in the body, lacking precise tissue targeting and strategic localization of immune cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Lymphocyte homing is primarily the process of lymphocyte maturation and differentiation within primary lymphoid organs, such as the thymus and bone marrow, ensuring they develop the necessary receptors and effector functions to recognize diverse antigens and mediate immune responses, focusing on lymphocyte development rather than migration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Lymphocyte homing describes the engulfment and phagocytosis of pathogens by lymphocytes within tissues, preventing infection spread and promoting pathogen clearance through innate immune mechanisms, misattributing phagocytic function to lymphocytes and conflating homing with pathogen elimination.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Lymphocyte homing is essentially the aggregation and accumulation of lymphocytes at sites of tissue damage or injury to initiate repair processes and restore tissue homeostasis after injury, primarily involved in tissue repair rather than antigen-specific immune responses or pathogen defense."

                        "goodAnswer": "Chemokines, such as CCL21 and CCL19, secreted by lymph node stromal cells and dendritic cells, and adhesion molecules, like L-selectin on naive lymphocytes and integrins (LFA-1) interacting with ICAM-1 on HEV endothelial cells, are crucial for guiding lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes through a multi-step adhesion cascade involving rolling, activation, adhesion, and transmigration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Antibodies circulating in the bloodstream bind to lymphocytes and target them to specific lymphoid organs, ensuring antigen-specific lymphocyte accumulation at sites of infection by antibody-mediated targeting and immune complex formation, which is not the primary mechanism of lymphocyte homing to lymphoid organs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Cytokines released by activated immune cells at peripheral inflammatory sites recruit lymphocytes to specific lymphoid organs, amplifying systemic immune responses and promoting localized inflammation within lymphoid tissues, reversing the direction of lymphocyte recruitment from lymphoid organs to inflammatory sites.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Naive lymphocytes primarily home to secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, to continuously scan for their specific antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells, facilitating antigen encounter and initiating adaptive immune responses, while effector lymphocytes, upon activation, alter their homing receptors to preferentially migrate to peripheral tissues and sites of inflammation to execute their effector functions, like cytotoxicity or cytokine secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Naive lymphocytes circulate throughout the entire body without specific tissue preferences or homing patterns, whereas effector lymphocytes are strictly restricted to secondary lymphoid organs to prevent autoimmunity and confine their immune activity within lymphoid tissues, limiting their access to peripheral sites of infection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Naive lymphocytes home exclusively to primary lymphoid organs, such as the thymus and bone marrow, for maturation and further differentiation, while effector lymphocytes home to secondary lymphoid organs for antigen encounter, activation, and subsequent immune response initiation, reversing the roles of primary and secondary lymphoid organs in naive and effector lymphocyte homing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Naive lymphocytes primarily reside in peripheral tissues to provide immediate and broad protection against pathogens at the entry sites, while effector lymphocytes are stored and maintained in secondary lymphoid organs for long-term immunological memory and rapid recall responses upon antigen re-exposure, misattributing primary residence and function to naive and effector lymphocytes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Naive and effector lymphocytes exhibit essentially identical homing patterns, circulating randomly and uniformly throughout the body and responding to antigens wherever they encounter them, lacking differential homing behavior based on activation status and functional specialization."

                        "goodAnswer": "The spleen contains red pulp, composed of splenic cords and sinuses, which filters blood, removes old blood cells, and stores platelets, and white pulp, consisting of lymphoid tissue, including periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS) and follicles, which initiates immune responses against bloodborne antigens and pathogens, representing functional and structural compartmentalization within the spleen.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The spleen is structurally composed of cortex and medulla regions, analogous to lymph nodes. The cortex filters lymph fluid, while the medulla produces lymphocytes and antibodies for systemic immunity, directly mirroring lymph node structure and function and misapplying it to the spleen.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The spleen has distinct lobules, similar to the liver. Each lobule contains hepatocytes for detoxification and Kupffer cells for phagocytosis of bloodborne pathogens, resembling liver's lobular architecture and attributing hepatic functions to the spleen.",

The anterior segment filters blood and removes cellular debris, while the posterior segment primarily stores red blood cells and platelets, suggesting anatomical segmentation with functionally distinct regions, which is not a standard description of spleen structure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The spleen is fundamentally a hollow organ with a central cavity filled with blood. The cavity is lined with specialized endothelial cells that filter blood and remove cellular debris and pathogens through direct blood-endothelial interaction, describing a simplified and inaccurate model of spleen's internal structure."

                        "goodAnswer": "Macrophages residing in the red pulp of the spleen, particularly within splenic cords, identify and phagocytose senescent or structurally abnormal red blood cells based on changes in their surface markers, such as phosphatidylserine exposure and decreased deformability, efficiently recycling iron and heme components for erythropoiesis and bilirubin production.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The spleen filters blood through specialized capillaries with extremely narrow intercellular openings and fenestrations that physically trap old and rigid red blood cells, mechanically removing them from circulation via size exclusion and physical entrapment within the splenic microvasculature.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The spleen secretes proteolytic enzymes directly into the bloodstream that selectively lyse old and damaged red blood cells, releasing hemoglobin and cellular components for subsequent removal and processing by the liver and kidneys, suggesting enzymatic lysis as the primary mechanism of red cell destruction in the spleen.",
