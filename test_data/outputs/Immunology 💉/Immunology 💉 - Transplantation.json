                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Acute cellular rejection, occurring within the first few weeks post-transplant, primarily mediated by recipient T-lymphocytes recognizing mismatched HLA antigens, leading to graft infiltration and parenchymal damage independent of ABO status.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Chronic antibody-mediated rejection, developing months to years post-transplant, characterized by a gradual decline in graft function due to donor-specific antibodies targeting non-ABO antigens and causing inflammation in the graft vasculature and parenchyma.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Delayed graft function, defined as the need for dialysis in the first week post-kidney transplant, primarily caused by ischemic injury during organ preservation and unrelated to ABO incompatibility or pre-existing antibodies.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Desensitization protocols primarily focus on inducing T-cell tolerance to donor ABO antigens through thymic education and clonal deletion of ABO-reactive T-cells, thereby preventing acute cellular rejection but having minimal impact on pre-existing antibody responses.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "These protocols work by selectively blocking the interaction between recipient antibodies and donor ABO antigens using competitive inhibitors that neutralize antibody binding sites on endothelial cells, preventing antibody-antigen complex formation in the graft.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Desensitization protocols enhance the activity of recipient regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress the inflammatory cascade initiated by ABO antibody-antigen complexes, effectively mitigating downstream effector mechanisms like complement activation and neutrophil infiltration.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA molecules primarily function as co-stimulatory signals for B cell activation, directly inducing antibody production against donor antigens independently of T cell involvement in allograft rejection, bypassing the conventional T-cell dependent alloimmune response.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "HLA molecules mainly regulate natural killer (NK) cell activity in transplantation, where mismatched HLA ligands on donor cells fail to engage inhibitory NK cell receptors, leading to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and graft destruction, preventing graft acceptance.",

                        "goodAnswer": "HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR loci are paramount for HLA matching because they encode highly polymorphic MHC class I (A, B) and class II (DR) molecules that are major targets for both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell mediated alloimmune responses in transplantation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "HLA-C, HLA-E, and HLA-G loci are most critical due to their role in modulating natural killer (NK) cell inhibition and maternal-fetal tolerance, which, while important in other immunological contexts, are less directly associated with acute allograft rejection in solid organ transplantation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "HLA-DP and HLA-DQ loci are considered primary for matching due to their exclusive expression on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their potent ability to stimulate the indirect allorecognition pathway, leading to chronic antibody-mediated rejection in transplantation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "HLA-DM and HLA-DO loci are critically important for matching as they are intracellular MHC class II molecules involved in peptide loading and are the primary determinants of antigen presentation efficiency within the graft, directly influencing rejection severity.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Acceptable mismatch refers to intentionally allowing for mismatches at certain HLA loci or alleles with lower immunogenicity, particularly in deceased donor transplants when perfectly matched organs are unavailable and prolonged cold ischemia time poses a greater risk than limited HLA disparity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Acceptable mismatch implies permitting mismatches at HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci only when the recipient has pre-existing antibodies against these mismatched antigens, aiming to induce immune tolerance through antibody-mediated depletion of reactive immune clones, paradoxical to conventional matching principles.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Acceptable mismatch is exclusively considered in living donor transplantation to strategically leverage donor-recipient specific immunosuppression protocols, which are not ethically or logistically feasible in deceased donor settings, thus necessitating more relaxed HLA matching criteria.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Acceptable mismatch is defined as allowing mismatches only for HLA class I loci (HLA-A, -B, -C), while strict matching is always required for HLA class II loci (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) to prevent chronic rejection, reflecting a differential impact of class I and II mismatches on graft outcome.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The indirect pathway involves recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) processing and presenting donor HLA-derived peptides as foreign antigens, leading to a chronic, less intense but persistent T-cell response, primarily CD4+ T cells, and gradual graft damage characterized by fibrosis and vascular lesions over time.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The indirect pathway is responsible for hyperacute rejection, where pre-existing recipient antibodies against donor HLA antigens rapidly activate complement and cause immediate graft thrombosis and necrosis, unlike the direct pathway which mediates delayed cellular rejection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The indirect pathway primarily activates B cells to produce donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), leading to antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in the acute phase post-transplant, whereas the direct pathway mainly causes chronic T-cell mediated rejection characterized by parenchymal fibrosis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The indirect pathway induces graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in solid organ transplantation by recipient T cells attacking donor HLA antigens expressed on graft cells, while the direct pathway is not involved in GVHD but solely in acute rejection mediated by donor T cells.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) function by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which prevents the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells), thereby blocking IL-2 gene transcription and downstream T-cell activation, crucial for preventing both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "CNIs primarily act by directly inhibiting mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) kinase, suppressing T-cell proliferation and cytokine production by interfering with downstream signaling pathways essential for T-cell activation and clonal expansion, thus preventing acute cellular rejection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "CNIs selectively deplete activated T cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), eliminating primarily the effector T lymphocytes responsible for allorecognition and graft destruction in the early post-transplant period, thereby inducing immune quiescence.",

                        "goodAnswer": "mTOR inhibitors primarily block the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inhibiting cell cycle progression and proliferation, particularly of T and B cells, by disrupting IL-2 signaling and downstream effector functions, often used in steroid-sparing regimens or to mitigate CNI-related nephrotoxicity, whereas CNIs primarily inhibit T-cell activation by blocking IL-2 production.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "mTOR inhibitors, similar to CNIs, directly inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity, but they selectively target different isoforms of calcineurin, leading to a distinct profile of immunosuppressive effects with reduced nephrotoxicity compared to CNIs and a preferential effect on B-cell responses.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "mTOR inhibitors induce apoptosis of activated T cells and B cells through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by directly activating caspase cascades, providing potent immunosuppression especially in acute rejection episodes, unlike CNIs which mainly prevent T-cell activation and cytokine production.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "mTOR inhibitors enhance the expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells, promoting T-cell exhaustion and anergy, which leads to long-term graft acceptance and reduced risk of chronic rejection, while CNIs mainly target early T-cell activation events and have minimal impact on T-cell exhaustion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "mTOR inhibitors function as potent co-stimulatory blockers, preventing the crucial interaction between CD40 on T cells and CD40L on antigen-presenting cells, thus inhibiting T-cell activation and subsequent cytokine production similar to CNIs, but with a distinct spectrum of side effects and clinical applications."

                        "goodAnswer": "Antibody induction therapy in the early post-transplant period aims to provide profound immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection by depleting recipient T cells (ATG) or blocking IL-2 receptor signaling (basiliximab), allowing maintenance immunosuppression to be initiated at lower doses and minimizing early rejection risk, particularly in immunologically high-risk recipients.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Induction therapy is primarily used to treat established acute rejection episodes by rapidly reversing ongoing immune responses and restoring graft function, rather than for prophylactic prevention in the early post-transplant phase, serving as rescue therapy in cases of steroid-resistant rejection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Induction therapy selectively targets B cells to prevent antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) by depleting pre-existing donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) and inhibiting de novo DSA production in sensitized recipients, thus focusing on humoral immunity rather than cellular immunity.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Corticosteroids exert broad immunosuppressive effects by multiple mechanisms, including reducing cytokine production (IL-1, IL-2, TNF-\u03b1), inhibiting leukocyte migration and activation, inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, and modulating inflammatory gene expression; they are used for induction, maintenance, and rejection treatment but are limited by significant long-term side effects like diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Corticosteroids selectively inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity, similar to CNIs, but with a more rapid onset of action and a shorter half-life, making them ideal for acute rejection rescue therapy but less suitable for long-term maintenance immunosuppression due to rebound inflammation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Corticosteroids primarily target B cells to suppress antibody production and are therefore mainly used in the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and desensitization protocols, with minimal effect on T-cell mediated cellular rejection or maintenance immunosuppression.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Liver, spleen, and thymus are the primary sources of HSCs for transplantation; liver HSCs are readily accessible and provide rapid engraftment, spleen HSCs offer superior graft-versus-tumor effect due to enriched immune cell populations, thymus HSCs are ideal for pediatric transplants due to inherent higher immune tolerance, representing alternative and less conventional HSC sources.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Lymph nodes, tonsils, and adenoids are rich sources of HSCs utilized for transplantation in immunocompromised patients; lymph node HSCs enhance immune reconstitution due to lymphatic homing properties, tonsillar HSCs reduce GVHD risk through local immune modulation, adenoidal HSCs promote long-term graft survival due to unique stem cell niches, portraying unconventional and less established HSC sources.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The allo-HSCT process encompasses donor selection and HLA typing -> recipient conditioning regimen (myeloablative or reduced-intensity) -> hematopoietic stem cell infusion -> engraftment monitoring (blood counts, chimerism) -> graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and management -> infection prevention strategies -> long-term follow-up for relapse, GVHD, and late complications, representing a complex, sequential, and multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Allo-HSCT involves patient diagnosis -> chemotherapy induction to achieve remission -> remission consolidation therapy -> hematopoietic stem cell mobilization -> peripheral blood stem cell collection -> cryopreservation of HSCs -> HSC reinfusion -> post-transplant recovery and supportive care, outlining the steps for autologous HSCT, not allogeneic, and misrepresenting the donor aspect.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The primary purpose of the conditioning regimen in HSCT is threefold: 1) to eradicate recipient hematopoietic cells and malignant clones, 2) to create space in the bone marrow niche for donor HSC engraftment, and 3) to induce immunosuppression in the recipient to prevent graft rejection; the two main types are myeloablative conditioning (MAC) using high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) employing lower doses for less toxicity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Conditioning regimens in HSCT are used to stimulate endogenous bone marrow regeneration and enhance HSC proliferation in situ within the recipient's marrow, promoting rapid hematopoietic recovery without requiring donor HSC infusion or immunosuppression, aiming for self-renewal of recipient hematopoiesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Conditioning regimens target and selectively eliminate malignant cells residing in the bone marrow and extramedullary sites, aiming to achieve complete disease remission before HSC transplantation, and are primarily utilized in autologous HSCT for cancer treatment to purify the stem cell graft from tumor cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Conditioning in allogeneic HSCT is designed to intentionally induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effect and eliminate residual cancer cells through donor T-cell alloreactivity, while simultaneously minimizing the risk of graft rejection by recipient immunity, paradoxically aiming for GVHD induction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Conditioning regimens are exclusively employed in umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) to overcome the inherent low cell dose in UCB grafts and promote more efficient engraftment and faster hematopoietic recovery, regardless of recipient age or underlying disease status, specifically tailored for UCBT cell dose limitations."

                        "goodAnswer": "Donor selection for allo-HSCT is primarily based on HLA matching, prioritizing HLA-identical siblings as first choice, followed by matched unrelated donors (MUDs) identified through registries, or haploidentical family members as alternative options; ABO compatibility, CMV serostatus of donor and recipient, donor age, and general donor health are also critical factors considered to optimize graft outcome and minimize transplant-related complications.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Donor selection for HSCT is primarily guided by ABO blood group matching, with HLA matching being of secondary importance and less critical for successful engraftment and GVHD prevention in allogeneic transplantation, as ABO compatibility is considered the paramount determinant of graft acceptance and immune tolerance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Recipient age and disease stage are the most influential factors in donor selection for HSCT, with younger donors and patients in earlier disease stages inherently having better transplantation outcomes irrespective of HLA matching, donor source, or other donor-recipient characteristics, emphasizing recipient and donor demographics over HLA compatibility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Geographic proximity and logistical feasibility are the main determinants of donor selection for HSCT, with local or regionally available donors preferentially selected to minimize HSC transportation time and associated costs, regardless of HLA compatibility, ABO matching, or other crucial donor characteristics, prioritizing logistics over immunological compatibility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Donor gender and ethnicity are the primary selection criteria for HSCT, with gender-matched donors and ethnically similar donors exhibiting superior engraftment rates and reduced GVHD incidence in allogeneic HSCT due to presumed genetic compatibility beyond HLA, focusing on demographic concordance over immunological factors."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Engraftment phases post-HSCT are categorized as pre-engraftment phase (0-7 days), early engraftment phase (7-21 days), and late engraftment phase (>21 days); key complications in these phases are hyperacute rejection in pre-engraftment, acute GVHD in early engraftment, and chronic GVHD in late engraftment, temporally linking specific complications to defined engraftment periods, inaccurately applying rejection terminology to HSCT engraftment.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "HSCT process phases are stem cell mobilization phase, collection phase, cryopreservation phase, and infusion phase; potential complications in each phase are mobilization failure, inadequate stem cell collection, cryopreservation-induced cell damage, and infusion reactions, focusing on procedural steps rather than post-infusion engraftment and its immunological milestones.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Phases of HSCT treatment are induction phase, consolidation phase, maintenance phase, and relapse phase; typical complications are induction failure, consolidation regimen toxicity, maintenance therapy non-compliance, and relapse of underlying disease, describing phases and complications of cancer therapy, not HSCT engraftment specifically.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Primary complication categories post-transplant are surgical complications (bleeding, vascular thrombosis, anastomotic leak), anesthetic complications (respiratory depression, perioperative cardiac arrest), pre-transplant complications (pre-existing donor organ failure, recipient co-morbidities), and psychological complications (post-transplant anxiety, depression), categorizing complications based on etiology or timing rather than major clinical domains.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Key complication categories in transplantation include technical complications (graft ischemia, vascular thrombosis, ureteric obstruction), immunological complications (hyperacute rejection, delayed graft function), metabolic complications (new-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia), and nutritional complications (post-transplant malnutrition, obesity), focusing on technical, immunological, and metabolic aspects, omitting other significant categories like infections and malignancies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Complications post-transplant can be temporally categorized as early complications (within 1 month post-transplant), intermediate complications (1-6 months), late complications (>6 months), and very late complications (>5 years); examples include acute rejection (early), CMV infection (intermediate), chronic rejection (late), and de novo malignancy (very late), classifying complications based on time of onset post-transplant, a less clinically focused categorization.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in solid organ transplantation is characterized by donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) targeting graft endothelium, leading to complement activation, endothelial cell injury, and microvascular inflammation and thrombosis; it differs from acute cellular rejection, which is T-cell mediated and involves lymphocytic infiltration and parenchymal damage, requiring distinct management strategies: AMR necessitates antibody-depleting therapies like plasmapheresis and IVIG plus B-cell suppression, while cellular rejection is treated with T-cell depleting or non-depleting immunosuppressants.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "AMR is considered a delayed form of cellular rejection that manifests months to years post-transplant, characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis, managed by intensifying maintenance immunosuppression with mTOR inhibitors and corticosteroids, unlike acute cellular rejection which occurs early and is treated with pulse steroids, misrepresenting AMR pathophysiology and chronicity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "AMR is a type of hyperacute rejection occurring within minutes to hours post-transplant due to pre-existing recipient antibodies against donor ABO antigens, requiring immediate graft removal and re-transplantation as the primary management strategy, unlike acute cellular rejection which develops over days to weeks and is treated with immunosuppression, conflating AMR with ABO-incompatible rejection and hyperacute presentation.",
