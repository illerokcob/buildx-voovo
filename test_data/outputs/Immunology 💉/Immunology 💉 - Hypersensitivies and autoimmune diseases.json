                        "goodAnswer": "Eosinophils play a central role, recruited to the airways by chemokines like eotaxin, and release inflammatory mediators such as major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, contributing to airway damage, mucus production, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Neutrophils play a central role, primarily involved in bacterial infections, releasing lysosomal enzymes like elastase and myeloperoxidase, causing acute airway inflammation and tissue damage, but less implicated in chronic allergic asthma pathology.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Macrophages play a central role, phagocytosing debris and pathogens in the lungs, and while they contribute to inflammation by releasing cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, they are not the primary drivers of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Natural killer (NK) cells play a central role, mediating antiviral immunity by releasing perforin and granzymes, and while they can contribute to airway inflammation in viral-induced asthma exacerbations, they are not central to chronic allergic asthma.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Platelets play a central role, involved in blood clotting and wound healing, releasing growth factors and cytokines that promote airway remodeling, but they are not the primary effector cells driving the acute inflammatory process in allergic asthma."

                        "goodAnswer": "Th2 lymphocytes release cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are particularly significant in allergic asthma. IL-4 promotes IgE class switching in B cells, IL-5 activates eosinophils, and IL-13 induces mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperresponsiveness, collectively driving airway inflammation and obstruction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Th1 lymphocytes release IFN-\u03b3, activating macrophages and promoting cell-mediated immunity, which is the dominant T cell subset in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and reduces airway inflammation in allergic asthma by suppressing Th2 responses.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Th17 lymphocytes release IL-17, primarily involved in neutrophil recruitment and bacterial infections, contributing to neutrophilic asthma phenotypes associated with severe exacerbations, but not the typical Th2-driven allergic asthma.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress immune responses and prevent airway inflammation by releasing IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and their deficiency contributes to asthma pathogenesis by failing to control Th2-mediated inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly kill bronchial epithelial cells, causing airway damage and obstruction in severe asthma, and they are the primary drivers of airway remodeling and irreversible airflow limitation in chronic asthmatic disease."

                        "goodAnswer": "Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells is primarily mediated by T lymphocytes, specifically CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and Th1 CD4+ cells, targeting beta cell autoantigens such as insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and islet antigen-2 (IA-2), leading to insulin deficiency.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Insulin resistance in peripheral tissues due to chronic exposure to high glucose levels is the primary mechanism, causing impaired glucose uptake and hyperglycemia, with no significant autoimmune involvement or destruction of pancreatic beta cells in T1DM.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Deposition of amyloid plaques in the pancreas, similar to Alzheimer's disease, disrupts beta cell function and insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia, and this process is independent of autoimmune mechanisms or T cell involvement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Antibody-mediated blockade of insulin receptors on target cells, such as muscle and liver cells, prevents insulin signaling and causes glucose intolerance, and these blocking autoantibodies are the primary cause of hyperglycemia in T1DM.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Viral infection of pancreatic alpha cells, leading to excessive glucagon production and subsequent hyperglycemia, triggers a non-immune mediated destruction of alpha cells and an imbalance in insulin-glucagon ratio, causing T1DM."

                        "goodAnswer": "While autoantibodies against beta cell antigens (e.g., anti-GAD, anti-insulin) are present in T1DM and serve as diagnostic markers, they are primarily considered markers of autoimmunity rather than primary mediators of beta cell destruction; T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the dominant pathogenic mechanism.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Autoantibodies are the primary mediators of beta cell destruction in T1DM, directly causing cell lysis and complement-mediated damage, and they are more important than T cells in the initial and progressive loss of beta cell mass and function.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Autoantibodies block insulin receptors on beta cells, preventing insulin secretion and leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia, and this receptor blockade is the principal mechanism of disease initiation and progression in T1DM.",
