                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Early childhood exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (first disruptive hit) severely disrupting the developing nasal microbiome, followed by subsequent exposure to ubiquitous fungal spores (second opportunistic hit) inducing a chronic fungal rhinosinusitis and subsequent polypogenesis through fungal sensitization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "An underlying genetic defect in fundamental mucociliary transport mechanisms (first predisposing hit) causing chronic mucus stasis within the sinuses, which is then invariably complicated by recurrent acute rhinosinusitis episodes (second inflammatory hit) leading to nasal polyp formation from repeated cycles of unresolved inflammation.",
