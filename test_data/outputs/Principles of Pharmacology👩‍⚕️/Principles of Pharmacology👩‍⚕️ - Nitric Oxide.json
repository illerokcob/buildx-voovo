                        "goodAnswer": "While inhaled nitric oxide consistently demonstrates improvements in oxygenation and reductions in pulmonary artery pressure in ARDS patients, robust clinical trials have not unequivocally shown a significant and sustained reduction in overall mortality rates in adult ARDS populations, suggesting it primarily serves as a supportive, temporizing measure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Inhaled nitric oxide has been definitively proven to significantly reduce mortality across all etiologies and severity spectrums of ARDS, as it directly targets the underlying inflammatory cascade and prevents progression to irreversible multi-organ failure, establishing it as a cornerstone of ARDS-specific therapy.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Sudden discontinuation of inhaled nitric oxide can induce systemic hypotension due to the abrupt loss of systemic vasodilation previously maintained by iNO, potentially resulting in hemodynamic instability and requiring immediate vasopressor support to restore adequate systemic blood pressure and organ perfusion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Rapid withdrawal of inhaled nitric oxide can trigger acute bronchospasm as a result of increased airway reactivity and smooth muscle contraction, necessitating immediate administration of bronchodilator therapy and potentially leading to respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Immediate cessation of inhaled nitric oxide can lead to a sudden surge in methemoglobin levels, as the body's endogenous compensatory mechanisms for methemoglobin reduction are overwhelmed, potentially resulting in clinically significant methemoglobinemia and subsequent tissue hypoxia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Abrupt discontinuation of inhaled nitric oxide can induce a pronounced hyperinflammatory response within the pulmonary parenchyma, exacerbating underlying lung injury and significantly increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other nosocomial infectious complications in ARDS patients."
