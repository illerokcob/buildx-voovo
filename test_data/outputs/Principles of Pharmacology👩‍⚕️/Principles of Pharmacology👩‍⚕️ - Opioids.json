                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Buprenorphine's full agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors ensures potent analgesia and complete suppression of withdrawal symptoms, but its lack of antagonist activity increases the risk of respiratory depression and overdose.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Naltrexone's shorter duration of action necessitates frequent administration, making it less practical for long-term maintenance treatment of opioid dependence but suitable for acute opioid overdose reversal in emergency settings.",
