                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Dopamine is predominantly broken down by Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) within the synapse, resulting in choline and acetic acid as the main degradation products.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary degradation pathway for dopamine involves peptidases and proteases in the synaptic cleft, which cleave dopamine into smaller amino acid fragments that are then reabsorbed by glial cells.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Levodopa acts as a precursor to dopamine; it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase in the brain, thereby replenishing dopamine levels in the striatum.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Carbidopa, a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, is co-administered with levodopa to prevent the premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, thereby reducing peripheral side effects and increasing levodopa bioavailability in the brain.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Carbidopa is given with levodopa to enhance the transport of levodopa across the blood-brain barrier by competitively inhibiting peripheral transporters that would otherwise restrict levodopa entry into the CNS.",
