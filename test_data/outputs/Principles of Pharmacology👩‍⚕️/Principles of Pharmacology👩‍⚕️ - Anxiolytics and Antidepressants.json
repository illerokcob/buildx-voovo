                        "goodAnswer": "Tolerance to one drug in a class (e.g., benzodiazepines) can confer tolerance to other drugs in the same or similar class (e.g., barbiturates, alcohol) due to shared mechanisms of action on GABA-A receptors.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Tolerance to one drug class (e.g., benzodiazepines) can paradoxically increase sensitivity to drugs in a different class (e.g., opioids), leading to enhanced effects and increased risk of adverse reactions.",
