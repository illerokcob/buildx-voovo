                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 on B cells, leading to B cell depletion, mainly used in B cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases, but not directly targeting the IL-2 receptor or its signaling.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TNF-alpha, reducing inflammation in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, but not directly blocking the IL-2 receptor or T cell proliferation.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Both classes of drugs can target rapidly dividing cells, albeit with differing selectivity; immunosuppressants selectively dampen immune cell proliferation, while chemotherapy agents broadly target rapidly proliferating cancer cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Both immunosuppressants and chemotherapy agents primarily function by directly inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells as their principal mechanism of action to achieve therapeutic efficacy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Both categories of drugs directly target DNA replication and repair mechanisms within rapidly dividing cells, causing DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, ultimately leading to cell death or growth inhibition.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Both immunosuppressants and chemotherapy agents selectively inhibit angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) in target tissues, thereby depriving cells of essential nutrients and oxygen, leading to cell death or growth arrest.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Both classes of drugs primarily modulate the activity of specific intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway or the PI3K-Akt pathway, to achieve their respective therapeutic outcomes in immune modulation or cancer treatment."

                        "goodAnswer": "Impaired immunosurveillance resulting from chronic immunosuppression reduces the body's capacity to effectively detect and eliminate virus-infected and transformed cells, elevating the risk of virus-associated cancers such as PTLD and skin cancer.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Direct carcinogenic effects of immunosuppressive drugs induce mutations in cellular DNA, directly promoting malignant transformation in various tissues, leading to a generalized increase in cancer incidence across multiple organ systems.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Synergistic toxicities between immunosuppressants and environmental carcinogens enhance the carcinogenic potential of environmental exposures, accelerating cancer development in transplant recipients through combined genotoxic effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Increased chronic inflammation due to immunosuppression paradoxically fosters tumor initiation and progression by establishing a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, stimulating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion mechanisms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Drug-induced epigenetic modifications caused by immunosuppressants alter gene expression patterns in cells, leading to the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, thereby promoting cancer development through epigenetic dysregulation."
