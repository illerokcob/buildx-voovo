                        "goodAnswer": "The colon begins at the cecum in the right iliac fossa, ascends as the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure, becomes the transverse colon across the abdomen, descends as the descending colon to the splenic flexure, becomes the sigmoid colon in the left iliac fossa, and continues as the rectum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The colon begins at the pylorus, ascends as the duodenum to the duodenojejunal flexure, becomes the jejunum in the upper abdomen, descends as the ileum to the ileocecal valve, and continues as the cecum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The colon begins at the esophagus, ascends as the cardia to the fundus, becomes the body in the mid-abdomen, descends as the antrum to the pylorus, and continues as the duodenum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The colon begins at the nasal cavity, ascends as the nasopharynx to the oropharynx, becomes the laryngopharynx in the neck, descends as the trachea to the bronchi, and continues as the lungs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The colon begins at the oral cavity, ascends as the vestibule to the oral cavity proper, becomes the tongue in the floor of the mouth, descends as the teeth to the gingivae, and continues as the palate."

                        "goodAnswer": "The rectum is the pelvic segment of the large intestine, characterized by rectal ampulla and transverse rectal folds, while the anal canal is the terminal segment, located perineally, containing anal columns, sinuses, valves, and internal and external anal sphincters.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The rectum is the abdominal segment of the large intestine, characterized by haustra and teniae coli, while the anal canal is the initial segment, located in the right iliac fossa, containing the cecum and appendix.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The rectum is the thoracic segment of the digestive tract, characterized by esophageal glands and upper and lower esophageal sphincters, while the anal canal is the gastric segment, containing rugae and gastric pits.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The rectum is the nasal segment of the respiratory system, characterized by nasal conchae and olfactory epithelium, while the anal canal is the oral segment, containing teeth and tongue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The rectum and anal canal are anatomically indistinguishable, both characterized by simple columnar epithelium and lacking muscular sphincters, serving solely for water absorption."
