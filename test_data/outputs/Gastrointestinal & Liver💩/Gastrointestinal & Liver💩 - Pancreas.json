                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Bicarbonate ions in pancreatic juice acidify the intestinal contents to facilitate protein denaturation and enzyme activity. Ductal cells secrete bicarbonate using a H+/HCO3\u2212 symporter on the apical membrane, powered by ATP hydrolysis and intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Bicarbonate ions in pancreatic juice act as cofactors for pancreatic enzyme activity but do not directly affect the pH of the intestinal lumen. Ductal cells secrete bicarbonate through simple diffusion across the apical membrane, driven by the concentration gradient.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Bicarbonate ions in pancreatic juice primarily serve to inhibit bacterial growth in the duodenum and have a minimal role in pH regulation.

                        "goodAnswer": "Trypsin, once activated, plays a crucial role in the activation cascade by converting other pancreatic zymogens into their active forms. Specifically, trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin, procarboxypeptidases (A and B) to carboxypeptidases (A and B), and proelastase to elastase.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The pancreas is protected from self-digestion by several mechanisms: packaging enzymes as inactive zymogens, synthesizing trypsin inhibitor within acinar cells, and separating enzymes from cellular components by compartmentalization within organelles, alongside ductal modification of secreted juice.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Pancreatic self-digestion is prevented primarily by secreting enzymes in fully active forms, which are only activated upon reaching the target substrates in the intestinal lumen, and by the presence of mucus lining the pancreatic ducts.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The pancreas is protected from self-digestion solely by the rapid transport of enzymes out of the pancreas into the duodenum, preventing prolonged contact with pancreatic tissues, and by the dilution of enzymes in intestinal contents.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Pancreatic self-digestion is avoided by storing enzymes in lysosomes within acinar cells until secretion is stimulated and by the presence of bile salts which inhibit pancreatic enzyme activity within the pancreas.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The primary protection against pancreatic self-digestion is the high concentration of bicarbonate in pancreatic juice which neutralizes any prematurely activated enzymes within the pancreas, and by the presence of antioxidants."

Neural regulation involves parasympathetic stimulation via the vagus nerve, promoting enzyme secretion, and sympathetic inhibition.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Pancreatic enzyme secretion is hormonally regulated by insulin, which stimulates enzyme release, and glucagon, which inhibits it. Neural regulation is primarily sympathetic via the splanchnic nerves, promoting enzyme secretion and parasympathetic inhibition.",

Neural regulation involves somatic nervous system control via spinal nerves, promoting enzyme secretion and autonomic inhibition.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Calcium ions serve as a crucial second messenger in pancreatic acinar cells, mediating the effects of secretagogues like CCK and acetylcholine. Increased intracellular Ca2+ levels trigger the fusion of zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane and subsequent enzyme secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Calcium ions primarily inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion by promoting the degradation of zymogen granules and reducing their exocytosis from acinar cells, acting as a negative regulator of secretion.",
