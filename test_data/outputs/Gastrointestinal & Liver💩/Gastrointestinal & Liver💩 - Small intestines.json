                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Active absorption, which is paracellular and ATP-dependent, occurs primarily in the duodenum and is saturated at low calcium concentrations, while passive absorption, which is transcellular and concentration-gradient driven, is dominant in the ileum and jejunum under all calcium intake levels.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Migrating motor complexes (MMCs), the primary pattern during digestion, propel residual chyme and clear debris from the small intestine after nutrient absorption is complete, while tonic contractions maintain basal muscle tone and prevent backflow of intestinal contents into the stomach during digestion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Mass movements, rapid and powerful contractions, quickly transport large segments of chyme through the entire small intestine during digestion, while reverse peristalsis moves chyme proximally from the ileum back into the duodenum for more efficient and prolonged nutrient absorption.",

                        "goodAnswer": "ICCs, specialized cells within the smooth muscle layers, act as pacemaker cells, generating slow waves, which are rhythmic fluctuations in membrane potential that set the basal electrical rhythm and frequency of intestinal contractions. They also mediate neurotransmitter inputs from enteric neurons, translating neural signals into smooth muscle activity and initiating muscle contraction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "ICCs function as sensory neurons, detecting mechanical stretch and chemical stimuli in the intestinal lumen and initiating reflex contractions to regulate intestinal motility by directly innervating smooth muscle cells and releasing neurotransmitters in response to luminal content changes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "ICCs act as smooth muscle cells, directly contracting and relaxing to generate peristaltic and segmentation movements, controlling the force and velocity of intestinal propulsion through their intrinsic contractile properties and direct response to stimuli.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Fluid absorption is mainly driven by hydrostatic pressure gradients generated by intestinal contractions, forcing water and electrolytes across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream against osmotic forces and independent of solute transport mechanisms and aquaporin channels.",

                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Phase II reactions involve transport reactions, such as drug uptake (organic anion transporting polypeptides - OATPs) and efflux (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 - ABCB1/MDR1), facilitating drug distribution and elimination across biological membranes, primarily referring to membrane transport mechanisms and not metabolic conjugation reactions."

                        "question": "What is the significance of first-pass metabolism in drug bioavailability, and which organs are primarily involved in this process?",
                        "goodAnswer": "First-pass metabolism refers to the presystemic drug metabolism that occurs in the liver and intestine after oral administration, but before a drug reaches systemic circulation. This process can significantly reduce the bioavailability of orally administered drugs, as a substantial portion of the drug dose is metabolized and inactivated during its first passage through these organs, primarily by enzymes like CYP450 in hepatocytes and enterocytes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "First-pass metabolism refers to drug metabolism occurring in the kidneys and bladder after systemic circulation, enhancing drug elimination and reducing drug half-life in the body, mainly describing renal drug excretion processes post-absorption and not presystemic metabolism affecting bioavailability before reaching systemic circulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "First-pass metabolism refers to drug metabolism occurring in the lungs and heart during systemic circulation, modifying drug distribution and targeting to specific tissues and organs, mainly describing systemic drug distribution and metabolism within circulatory organs, not presystemic metabolism affecting oral bioavailability.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "First-pass metabolism refers to drug metabolism occurring in the brain and spinal cord before reaching peripheral tissues, altering drug penetration and efficacy in the central nervous system, describing central nervous system metabolism and drug distribution within the brain, not presystemic metabolism affecting oral drug bioavailability.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "First-pass metabolism refers to drug metabolism occurring in the skin and mucous membranes upon topical application, affecting drug absorption and local therapeutic effects, describing topical drug metabolism and local effects, not presystemic metabolism impacting oral drug bioavailability and systemic levels."
