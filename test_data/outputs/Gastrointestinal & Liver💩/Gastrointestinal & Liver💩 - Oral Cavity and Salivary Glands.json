                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Key organic components include insulin (glucose regulation), glucagon (glucose elevation), growth hormone (growth promotion), thyroid hormones (metabolic regulation), cortisol (stress response), and adrenaline (fight-or-flight response), primarily involved in endocrine regulation of metabolism, growth, and stress response throughout the body.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Key organic components include DNA polymerase (DNA replication), RNA polymerase (RNA transcription), ribosomes (protein synthesis), mitochondria (ATP production), lysosomes (cellular digestion), and endoplasmic reticulum (protein folding), primarily involved in cellular metabolism, genetic processes, and organelle functions within all cells."

                        "question": "What is the role of salivary mucins, specifically MG1 and MG2, in maintaining oral health, and how do their structural properties and functional characteristics contribute to saliva's viscoelasticity, lubrication, and protective barrier function against microbial adhesion and desiccation?",
                        "goodAnswer": "MG1 and MG2 mucins are large glycoproteins that impart viscoelasticity to saliva, providing lubrication, forming a protective barrier against microbial adhesion by steric hindrance and charge repulsion, and preventing desiccation of oral tissues through water retention and gel formation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "MG1 and MG2 mucins are small lipoproteins that facilitate lipid digestion in saliva, emulsifying dietary fats, promoting absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and enhancing nutrient uptake from food boluses within the oral cavity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "MG1 and MG2 mucins are fibrous structural proteins that provide tensile strength to saliva, maintaining its structural integrity, forming a scaffold for cell adhesion, and supporting tissue regeneration and wound healing within the oral mucosa.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "MG1 and MG2 mucins are enzymatic proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions in saliva, breaking down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into simpler molecules, facilitating initial digestion and nutrient processing before swallowing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "MG1 and MG2 mucins are hormonal proteins that regulate salivary gland function, stimulating saliva secretion, modulating ion transport across ductal cells, and controlling feedback mechanisms for saliva production and composition adjustment."
