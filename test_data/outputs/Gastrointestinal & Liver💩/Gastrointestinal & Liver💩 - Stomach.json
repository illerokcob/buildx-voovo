                        "goodAnswer": "Gastric motility is characterized by peristaltic contractions, which mix gastric contents and propel chyme towards the pylorus, and receptive relaxation of the proximal stomach (fundus and body), which accommodates increasing food volume without significant pressure increase.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Gastric motility primarily consists of segmentation contractions, which oscillate gastric contents back and forth to enhance nutrient absorption across the gastric mucosa, and mass movements, which rapidly propel gastric contents into the duodenum for efficient emptying.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Gastric motility is dominated by tonic contractions, which maintain constant pressure within the stomach to prevent gastroesophageal reflux and facilitate gradual osmotic breakdown of food, and migrating motor complexes, which cleanse the stomach during fasting periods.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Gastric motility involves reverse peristalsis, which propels undigested food back into the esophagus for regurgitation, and pendular movements, which mechanically break down large food particles through back-and-forth swinging motions within the stomach.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gastric motility is characterized by haustral contractions, which promote water absorption from gastric contents, and propulsive movements, which ensure unidirectional flow of chyme through the stomach towards the duodenum without mixing or churning."

                        "question": "Analyzing the regulation of gastric emptying, what are the principal neural and hormonal mechanisms that coordinate the rate at which chyme is released from the stomach into the duodenum, optimizing intestinal digestion and absorption?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Gastric emptying is primarily regulated by neural and hormonal reflexes originating from the duodenum (enterogastric reflex), sensing factors like acidity, distension, and nutrient content (especially fat), which act to slow gastric emptying when duodenal capacity is approached.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Gastric emptying is intrinsically regulated by pacemaker cells in the stomach wall, which rhythmically trigger gastric contractions and emptying at a constant rate, independent of feedback signals from the duodenum or intestinal conditions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The rate of gastric emptying is directly proportional to the volume of chyme in the stomach, with larger volumes leading to faster emptying rates due to increased pressure and distension, overriding any duodenal feedback mechanisms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Gastric emptying is primarily controlled by the central nervous system based on overall energy balance and hunger signals, with the brainstem directly regulating pyloric sphincter relaxation and contraction, disregarding local duodenal cues.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gastric emptying is regulated by the tonic contraction of the pyloric sphincter, which remains continuously constricted, periodically relaxing in response to gastric distension to allow small boluses of chyme to pass into the duodenum in a controlled manner."
