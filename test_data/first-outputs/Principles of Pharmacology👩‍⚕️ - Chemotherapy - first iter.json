                        "goodAnswer": "Pre-existing genetic and epigenetic diversity within the tumor cell population allows for selection of resistant clones upon chemotherapy exposure, leading to treatment failure and relapse.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Tumor heterogeneity actually reduces the likelihood of resistance because diverse cell populations are more susceptible to a broader range of chemotherapeutic agents, preventing resistance selection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Tumor heterogeneity promotes cellular differentiation and maturation, making cancer cells less proliferative and more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced cell death.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Tumor heterogeneity leads to increased immune surveillance and elimination of resistant clones by the host immune system, preventing the emergence of drug resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Tumor heterogeneity results in uniform drug distribution throughout the tumor mass, ensuring that all cancer cells are exposed to therapeutic drug concentrations and preventing resistance development."

                        "goodAnswer": "Increased expression of DNA repair enzymes, such as alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGAT) and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which can remove alkyl adducts from DNA and reverse drug-induced damage.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Decreased expression of drug influx transporters, which reduces the intracellular concentration of alkylating agents and limits their access to DNA targets within the cancer cell.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Upregulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, which leads to increased inactivation of alkylating agents and reduced intracellular drug levels.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mutation in the drug target proteins, such as tubulin or topoisomerases, that reduces the binding affinity of alkylating agents and diminishes their cytotoxic efficacy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Increased activity of pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, which makes cancer cells more susceptible to alkylating agent-induced apoptosis and prevents resistance development."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The tumor microenvironment enhances drug delivery to cancer cells by increasing blood vessel permeability and improving drug penetration into the tumor mass, thus overcoming resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The tumor microenvironment stimulates the host immune system to eliminate chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells, thereby preventing the development of acquired resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The tumor microenvironment provides essential nutrients and growth factors that make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced cell death and reduce resistance.",

                        "wrongAnswer_4": "CSCs enhance the immune response against the tumor, leading to immune-mediated elimination of both CSCs and bulk tumor cells and preventing chemotherapy resistance."
