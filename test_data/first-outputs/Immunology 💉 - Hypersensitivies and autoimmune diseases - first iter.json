                        "question": "What is the role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes?",
                        "goodAnswer": "While autoantibodies against beta cell antigens are present in T1DM, they are primarily considered markers of autoimmunity and their pathogenic role in beta cell destruction is less direct compared to T cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Autoantibodies are the primary mediators of beta cell destruction in T1DM, directly causing cell lysis and complement-mediated damage.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Autoantibodies block insulin receptors on beta cells, preventing insulin secretion and leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Autoantibodies form immune complexes in the pancreas, causing inflammation and tissue damage that indirectly leads to beta cell dysfunction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Autoantibodies neutralize insulin in the circulation, reducing its effectiveness and causing hyperglycemia in T1DM."
