                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Each chain, \u03b1 and \u03b2, is composed of only a constant (C) domain and a transmembrane region, lacking variable domains and CDRs for antigen specificity.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Each TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain variable domain contains three CDR loops (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3), with CDR3 being the most variable and crucial for determining peptide-MHC specificity, located at the V-J junction in \u03b1 and V-D-J junction in \u03b2 chains.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "TCR antigen specificity is determined by six CDR loops, three on the \u03b1 chain and three on the \u03b2 chain, all of which are equally variable and located within the constant domains of the TCR.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "TCR specificity relies on only two CDR loops, CDR1 and CDR2, which are highly conserved and located in the framework regions, not the variable domains, of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The TCR \u03b1 chain has four CDR loops, while the \u03b2 chain has only two, with CDR loops primarily contributing to the overall structural stability of the receptor rather than antigen binding.",

                        "goodAnswer": "TCR engagement with peptide-MHC triggers signaling cascades in T cells, and this interaction is stabilized and enhanced by CD4 or CD8 co-receptors binding to the MHC molecule, with CD4 interacting with MHC class II and CD8 with MHC class I.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "TCR-peptide-MHC interaction directly induces T cell activation without the need for co-receptors like CD4 or CD8, which are only involved in T cell development in the thymus.",

                        "question": "How do different subsets of CD4+ helper T cells (e.g., Th1, Th2, Th17) contribute to distinct types of immune responses?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Different Th subsets, like Th1 (cellular immunity against intracellular pathogens), Th2 (humoral immunity against extracellular parasites and allergens), and Th17 (inflammation and autoimmunity), secrete distinct sets of cytokines that promote specific effector mechanisms and tailored immune responses.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "All CD4+ T cell subsets perform identical effector functions, differing only in their tissue distribution and activation thresholds, but not in the type of immune response they induce.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets are stages in the differentiation pathway of all CD4+ T cells, with each cell sequentially transitioning through these stages to become fully functional.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Th1 cells are specialized in suppressing immune responses, Th2 cells promote cytotoxicity, and Th17 cells are involved in antibody production, representing a reversed functional assignment.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The classification of CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets is primarily based on their chemokine receptor expression, not on the cytokines they produce or the effector functions they mediate."
