                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hemidesmosomes facilitate intercellular communication by forming gap junctions between epithelial cells; structurally, they are composed of connexins and allow direct cytoplasmic exchange, similar to desmosomes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Hemidesmosomes create tight seals between epithelial cells, preventing paracellular transport of molecules; structurally, they utilize claudins and occludins, functionally similar to desmosomes in barrier formation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Hemidesmosomes mediate cell-cell adhesion, linking adjacent epithelial cells together; structurally, they involve cadherins and actin filaments, functionally identical to desmosomes in cell-cell anchoring.",
