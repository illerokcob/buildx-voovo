                        "goodAnswer": "Frequent suckling by the infant inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which suppresses ovulation by reducing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The prolactin surge during breastfeeding directly thickens the cervical mucus, preventing sperm penetration and thus blocking fertilization from occurring in the fallopian tubes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Lactation increases estrogen levels, which in turn creates a negative feedback loop on the ovaries, preventing follicular development and subsequent ovulation for up to six months postpartum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Frequent breastfeeding leads to a significant decrease in body fat percentage in the mother, causing hypothalamic amenorrhea due to insufficient energy reserves for ovulation to resume.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The physical act of breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin, which directly interferes with the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine lining, preventing pregnancy."

                        "goodAnswer": "Amenorrhea (absence of menses), full or nearly full breastfeeding (baby's primary source of nourishment), and less than six months postpartum are the essential criteria for LAM effectiveness.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Exclusive breastfeeding on demand, infant being under one year of age, and consistent use of a barrier method as a backup are the main conditions for achieving high effectiveness with LAM.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Regular night feedings, supplementation with formula only when medically necessary, and maternal age under 35 years are critical factors for LAM to be highly effective.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Maintaining a specific breastfeeding schedule (every 2-3 hours), using a breast pump in addition to direct breastfeeding, and absence of any vaginal bleeding are the crucial requirements for LAM.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Complete absence of supplemental foods for the infant, maternal body mass index (BMI) within the normal range, and consistent breastfeeding for at least 8 times in 24 hours are the necessary conditions for LAM's success."

                        "goodAnswer": "Elevated prolactin levels, stimulated by nipple stimulation during suckling, inhibit pulsatile GnRH release, thereby reducing LH and FSH and suppressing ovarian follicle development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Increased oxytocin secretion, triggered by breastfeeding, directly blocks the receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovaries, preventing ovulation from occurring.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Decreased estrogen production during lactation leads to thinning of the endometrial lining, making implantation unfavorable and indirectly preventing ovulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Elevated levels of beta-endorphins, released during breastfeeding, act centrally to suppress the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary gland.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Increased progesterone levels post-delivery, sustained by breastfeeding, create a hormonal environment similar to pregnancy, thereby inhibiting ovulation through negative feedback."

                        "goodAnswer": "Likely not, because the 'Reasonable at Time' standard assesses the provider's actions against the accepted medical practices and knowledge prevalent in 1980, not current standards.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Likely yes, because legal standards of care are always retrospectively applied based on the most recent advancements in medical science to ensure patient safety.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "It depends on whether the patient signed a consent form acknowledging the risks of contraceptive failure based on current, not past, understandings of effectiveness.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "It would depend on expert witness testimony establishing that even by 1980 standards, the provider's advice deviated significantly from the recognized standard of care at that time.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Yes, because patients have a fundamental right to effective contraception, and any failure, regardless of the time period, constitutes a breach of duty by the healthcare provider."

                        "goodAnswer": "CHCs primarily prevent ovulation by suppressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, leading to reduced follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Combined hormonal contraceptives mainly work by creating a hostile uterine environment that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, regardless of whether ovulation occurs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "CHCs function by thickening the cervical mucus to such an extent that sperm are physically unable to penetrate and reach the egg for fertilization, while ovulation remains unaffected.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Combined hormonal contraceptives increase the motility of the fallopian tubes, causing the egg to pass through too quickly to be fertilized by sperm in the ampullary region.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "CHCs induce a mild inflammatory response in the endometrium, which is toxic to sperm and prevents fertilization, while having minimal impact on ovulation or cervical mucus."

                        "goodAnswer": "While COCs reliably inhibit ovulation in most cycles, POPs inhibit ovulation less consistently, relying more on cervical mucus thickening and endometrial changes for contraception.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "POPs are more effective at inhibiting ovulation than COCs because they deliver a higher dose of progestin, which has a stronger suppressive effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "COCs primarily depend on cervical mucus thickening and endometrial atrophy for contraception, whereas POPs predominantly function by consistently blocking ovulation in every cycle.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "POPs and COCs both have the same primary mechanism of action: consistent and complete inhibition of ovulation through suppression of FSH and LH release from the pituitary gland.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The difference is that POPs inhibit ovulation by directly acting on the ovaries, while COCs inhibit ovulation indirectly through the hypothalamus and pituitary gland feedback loops."

                        "goodAnswer": "Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) create a physical barrier in the uterus and also release copper ions, which are toxic to sperm and impair sperm motility, preventing fertilization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Spermicides form a chemical barrier that immobilizes and kills sperm on contact before they can reach the cervix and enter the uterus, thus preventing fertilization.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Copper ions released by IUDs are toxic to sperm, impairing sperm motility and viability, and they also induce a local inflammatory response in the uterus that is spermicidal and prevents implantation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Copper ions primarily thicken the cervical mucus, creating a barrier that prevents sperm from migrating into the uterus and reaching the fallopian tubes for fertilization.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Frequent use of nonoxynol-9 spermicides may cause vaginal and rectal irritation, potentially increasing the risk of STI transmission by disrupting mucosal integrity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Long-term use of nonoxynol-9 spermicides can lead to a decreased vaginal pH, which offers enhanced protection against bacterial vaginosis but increases susceptibility to yeast infections.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Frequent spermicide use may cause systemic absorption of nonoxynol-9, leading to hormonal imbalances and potentially reducing fertility in women over time.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Consistent use of nonoxynol-9 spermicides has been shown to increase the risk of developing cervical cancer due to its cytotoxic effects on cervical cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Spermicides, especially those with nonoxynol-9, can cause allergic reactions in both men and women, leading to skin rashes and reducing the effectiveness of contraception."
