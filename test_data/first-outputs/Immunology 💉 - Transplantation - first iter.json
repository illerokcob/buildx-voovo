                        "wrongAnswer_1": "mTOR inhibitors, like CNIs, directly inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity, but they selectively target different isoforms of calcineurin, leading to a distinct profile of immunosuppressive effects and reduced nephrotoxicity compared to CNIs.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Induction therapy aims to provide intense immunosuppression in the immediate post-transplant period to prevent acute rejection by depleting or inactivating recipient T cells, allowing maintenance immunosuppression to be initiated at lower doses, particularly in high-risk recipients.",
