                        "goodAnswer": "Systolic heart failure is frequently caused by conditions that damage the myocardium, such as ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy, impairing contractility, whereas diastolic heart failure often results from conditions that increase ventricular stiffness, like hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hindering relaxation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Systolic heart failure is primarily caused by conditions that increase ventricular stiffness, such as hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hindering relaxation, whereas diastolic heart failure is frequently caused by conditions that damage the myocardium, like ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy, impairing contractility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Both systolic and diastolic heart failure are predominantly caused by valvular heart diseases, leading to either volume overload in systolic failure or pressure overload in diastolic failure, independent of myocardial or stiffness issues.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Initially, cardiac remodeling, such as hypertrophy and dilation, helps maintain cardiac output, but prolonged remodeling leads to maladaptive changes, including increased wall stress, fibrosis, and worsened function, contributing to decompensation.",
