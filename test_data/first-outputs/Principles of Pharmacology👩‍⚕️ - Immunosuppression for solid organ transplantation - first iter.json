                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 on B cells, leading to B cell depletion, primarily used in B cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases, not directly targeting IL-2 signaling.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TNF-alpha, reducing inflammation in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, but not directly blocking IL-2 receptor.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Abatacept, a fusion protein that blocks CD28-B7 co-stimulation, preventing T cell activation, used in rheumatoid arthritis and as a costimulation blocker in transplantation, but not targeting the IL-2 receptor.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits complement C5, preventing complement activation and membrane attack complex formation, used in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, not targeting IL-2 signaling."

                        "goodAnswer": "Both classes of drugs can target rapidly proliferating cells, although with different selectivity and therapeutic goals; immunosuppressants aim to selectively suppress immune cell proliferation, while chemotherapy targets broadly proliferating cancer cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Both immunosuppressants and chemotherapy agents primarily induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells as their main mechanism of action, leading to cell depletion and therapeutic effect.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Both classes of drugs directly target DNA replication and repair mechanisms in rapidly dividing cells, causing DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, leading to cell death or growth inhibition.",

                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Both classes of drugs primarily modulate the activity of specific intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway or the PI3K-Akt pathway, to achieve their therapeutic effects."
