                        "question": "In the treatment algorithm for status epilepticus, at what point is it recommended to consider non-pharmacological interventions such as rapid sequence intubation and airway management?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Early in the management, particularly if there is concern for airway compromise, aspiration risk, or prolonged seizure activity impairing ventilation and oxygenation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Only after failure of multiple lines of pharmacological therapy and development of refractory status epilepticus, as airway management is a late-stage intervention.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Routinely in all patients with status epilepticus upon arrival to the emergency department, irrespective of their respiratory status or seizure severity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Only in patients with convulsive status epilepticus, as non-convulsive status epilepticus does not typically require airway management.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "When EEG monitoring confirms electrographic status epilepticus, irrespective of clinical seizure manifestations or respiratory status."
