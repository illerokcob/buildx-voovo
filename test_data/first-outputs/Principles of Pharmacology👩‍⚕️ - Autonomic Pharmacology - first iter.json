                        "goodAnswer": "It is characterized by a two-neuron chain, involving preganglionic neurons originating in the CNS and postganglionic neurons located in peripheral ganglia, with the enteric nervous system functioning largely independently within the gastrointestinal tract.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "It consists of a single neuron pathway directly connecting the central nervous system to effector organs, with ganglia located exclusively within the brainstem and spinal cord, and the enteric system acting as a direct extension of the somatic motor system.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Presynaptic depolarization causes an efflux of sodium ions (Na+) through voltage-gated sodium channels, which directly forces ACh molecules out of the nerve terminal into the synaptic cleft via diffusion.",
