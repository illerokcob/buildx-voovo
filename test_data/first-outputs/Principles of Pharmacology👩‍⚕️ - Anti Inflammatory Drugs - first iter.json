                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Glucocorticoid replacement should be administered only during periods of stress or illness to avoid chronic suppression of the HPA axis and minimize long-term side effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Glucocorticoid replacement therapy typically involves administering high doses of long-acting glucocorticoids every few days to provide sustained adrenal support and reduce the frequency of dosing."

                        "goodAnswer": "Gradual tapering of the glucocorticoid dose over weeks or months is recommended to allow the HPA axis to recover and resume endogenous cortisol production, thereby preventing adrenal insufficiency and withdrawal symptoms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Abrupt cessation of glucocorticoids is preferred to avoid prolonged exposure to exogenous steroids and minimize the risk of long-term side effects, as the HPA axis will recover rapidly in most patients.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Intermittent dosing of glucocorticoids, such as alternate-day therapy, is an effective way to prevent steroid withdrawal syndrome while still providing adequate therapeutic benefit and minimizing HPA axis suppression.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Prophylactic administration of ACTH-stimulating agents during glucocorticoid withdrawal can rapidly restore adrenal function and prevent withdrawal symptoms, making tapering unnecessary.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Concurrent administration of mineralocorticoids during glucocorticoid tapering is crucial to prevent steroid withdrawal syndrome by maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing hypotension."

                        "goodAnswer": "TNF-alpha inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab, directly bind to and neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), preventing it from binding to its receptors and initiating downstream inflammatory signaling pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "TNF-alpha inhibitors enhance the degradation of TNF-alpha mRNA, thereby reducing the synthesis of TNF-alpha protein and its subsequent inflammatory effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "TNF-alpha inhibitors act by blocking the TNF-alpha receptor on immune cells, preventing TNF-alpha from binding and activating intracellular signaling cascades.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "TNF-alpha inhibitors stimulate the production of endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, which then counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of TNF-alpha.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "TNF-alpha inhibitors directly inhibit the enzyme responsible for the production of TNF-alpha, such as TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), thus reducing TNF-alpha levels."
