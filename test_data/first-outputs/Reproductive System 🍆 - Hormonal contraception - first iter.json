                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Desogestrel is converted to etonogestrel through glucuronidation at the C-3 position, which enhances its binding affinity to progesterone receptors and extends its half-life in circulation.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Potency refers to the amount of drug (typically in mg or mcg) needed to produce a specific effect of a given magnitude, while dose is the quantity of drug administered to achieve a therapeutic effect, with potency being inversely related to the ED50.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Potency indicates the duration of action of a drug, whereas dose refers to the frequency of drug administration required to maintain therapeutic levels, with potency being directly proportional to the drug's half-life.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The ED50 is the dose of a drug that produces the maximum possible therapeutic effect, indicating the drug's efficacy ceiling and the point beyond which increasing the dose does not yield additional benefit.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The ED50 is the dose of a drug that causes toxicity in 50% of the population, representing the median toxic dose (TD50) and serving as an indicator of drug safety and potential for adverse effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The ED50 is the dose of a drug that results in a 50% reduction in symptom severity in individual patients, reflecting the variability in drug response and the need for personalized dosing regimens.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Drug A is more potent than Drug B because a smaller dose (10 mg vs 50 mg) of Drug A is required to achieve the same blood pressure lowering effect, indicating a higher affinity for the target receptor or greater efficacy per unit dose.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Drug B is more potent than Drug A because its higher ED50 value suggests a greater maximum efficacy in lowering blood pressure, implying a stronger therapeutic effect at higher doses compared to Drug A.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Drug A and Drug B have equal potency because they both produce the same therapeutic effect of lowering blood pressure, and potency is solely determined by the therapeutic outcome, not the dose required.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Drug A is likely to have a longer duration of action than Drug B due to its lower ED50, suggesting slower metabolism and elimination, resulting in sustained blood pressure control with less frequent dosing.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Drug B is safer than Drug A because its higher ED50 indicates a wider therapeutic index, implying a larger margin between the effective dose and the toxic dose, reducing the risk of adverse effects at therapeutic doses."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Alternative formulations consist of intramuscular injections of long-acting estrogen and progestin combinations, subcutaneous implants releasing estrogen only, and rectal suppositories containing progestin, offering varied routes but similar pharmacokinetic profiles.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The primary mechanism is the induction of a hostile uterine environment that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg by causing endometrial atrophy and reducing uterine receptivity, thus hindering pregnancy establishment.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Estrogen directly blocks progesterone receptors in the ovaries, preventing progesterone production and thereby disrupting the ovarian cycle, while progestin inhibits estrogen synthesis, leading to overall hormonal imbalance and ovulation failure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Estrogen and progestin both stimulate the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, but they act antagonistically on FSH and LH release from the pituitary, resulting in a net suppression of gonadotropin secretion and ovulation.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Perfect use efficacy of oral contraceptives is approximately 95%, with typical use efficacy dropping to around 80%, primarily due to variations in individual metabolism and drug absorption affecting hormone levels.",
