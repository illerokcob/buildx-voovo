                        "goodAnswer": "The SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the Testis-Determining Factor (TDF), a protein that initiates the development of the bipotential gonad into a testis by activating SOX9 and other downstream genes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The SRY gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the Ovarian-Determining Factor (ODF), a protein that suppresses testicular development and promotes ovarian differentiation in the bipotential gonad.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The SRY gene, located on an autosome, encodes the Gonadal-Determining Factor (GDF), a protein that is essential for the initial formation of the bipotential gonad but does not influence sex-specific differentiation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the Mullerian-Inhibiting Factor (MIF), a hormone that causes the regression of the Mullerian ducts and thereby prevents the formation of female reproductive structures in males.",

                        "goodAnswer": "In the absence of SRY, and consequently TDF, the bipotential gonad defaults to ovarian development, influenced by genes like WNT4 and DAX1, leading to the formation of ovaries and female reproductive structures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad undergoes spontaneous regression, leading to gonadal dysgenesis and the absence of both ovarian and testicular tissue, resulting in a sexually undifferentiated phenotype.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad is redirected towards testicular development due to the unopposed action of autosomal genes that promote male differentiation in all genetic backgrounds.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In the absence of SRY, the bipotential gonad develops into an ovotestis, containing both ovarian and testicular tissue, due to the lack of a definitive signal to specify either male or female fate.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen converted from testosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, is primarily responsible for the development of the penis, scrotum, and prostate from the external genital tubercle and urogenital sinus.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Testosterone, the main androgen produced by the testes, directly mediates the virilization of the external genitalia by binding to androgen receptors in the genital tubercle and initiating male phenotypic development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Estradiol, an estrogen produced by the placenta and fetal ovaries, is converted to DHT in target tissues and is the primary hormone responsible for the masculinization of the external genitalia and the brain.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Androstenedione, an adrenal androgen precursor, is converted to DHT in peripheral tissues and plays a crucial role in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, but not fetal virilization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Cortisol, a glucocorticoid produced by the adrenal glands, is converted to DHT in the genital skin and acts synergistically with testosterone to induce the development of male external genitalia during fetal life."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Deletion syndromes are caused by point mutations in single genes that are essential for sexual differentiation, such as the SRY gene or genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, leading to specific hormonal imbalances.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Deletion syndromes are caused by trisomy of sex chromosomes, such as XXY or XXX, resulting in an imbalance of sex chromosome dosage and subsequent disruptions in sexual development and fertility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Deletion syndromes are caused by uniparental disomy, where an individual inherits both copies of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other, leading to imprinting disorders and altered gene expression.",

                        "goodAnswer": "AIS is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome, resulting in a non-functional or partially functional androgen receptor protein that cannot effectively bind and respond to androgens.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "AIS is caused by defects in the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to reduced DHT production and impaired androgen action in DHT-dependent tissues.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "AIS is caused by deficiencies in steroidogenic enzymes, such as 21-hydroxylase or 11-beta-hydroxylase, leading to adrenal androgen excess and compensatory suppression of testicular androgen production.",
