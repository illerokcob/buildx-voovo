                        "wrongAnswer_1": "iNO significantly reduces mortality in all subtypes of ARDS regardless of etiology or severity, as it directly addresses the underlying inflammatory processes and prevents progression to multi-organ failure, making it a definitive treatment.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "iNO paradoxically increases mortality in patients with severe ARDS due to its potent vasodilatory effects leading to systemic hypotension and decreased cerebral perfusion, particularly in hemodynamically unstable individuals.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "iNO is contraindicated in ARDS patients with concomitant left ventricular dysfunction because it increases pulmonary blood flow, exacerbating pulmonary edema and leading to increased mortality in this specific subgroup.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Abrupt withdrawal of iNO can lead to rebound pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypoxemia, potentially worsening oxygenation and requiring re-escalation of ventilatory support or re-initiation of iNO therapy, necessitating a gradual weaning strategy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Sudden cessation of iNO can cause systemic hypotension due to the loss of systemic vasodilation previously maintained by iNO, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability and requiring vasopressor support.",
