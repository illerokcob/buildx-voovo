                        "goodAnswer": "Maintaining consistent and controlled scrotal hyperthermia over extended periods, requiring dedicated devices and user adherence, posing challenges for daily routine and comfort compared to a single pill.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The high cost and complexity of heat-based contraceptive devices, making them less accessible and affordable compared to widely available and inexpensive hormonal contraceptives.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The irreversible nature of heat-induced spermatogenic suppression, raising concerns about long-term fertility and limiting user adoption compared to reversible hormonal methods.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The immediate onset of contraceptive efficacy with heat-based methods, requiring a long washout period before achieving full contraceptive protection, unlike hormonal methods with rapid action.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The systemic side effects associated with heat exposure, such as fever and fatigue, making heat-based contraception less tolerable and safe compared to localized hormonal interventions."
