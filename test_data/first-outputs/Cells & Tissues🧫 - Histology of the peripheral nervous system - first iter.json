                        "goodAnswer": "Mechanosensory receptors are specialized nerve endings that respond to mechanical stimuli like pressure, touch, vibration, and stretch. They transduce these stimuli into electrical signals by opening mechanically gated ion channels, leading to depolarization or receptor potentials.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Mechanosensory receptors are specialized glial cells that respond to chemical stimuli like neurotransmitters and hormones. They transduce these stimuli into electrical signals by activating ligand-gated ion channels, leading to hyperpolarization or inhibitory potentials.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Mechanosensory receptors are specialized muscle fibers that respond to thermal stimuli like heat and cold. They transduce these stimuli into electrical signals by activating voltage-gated ion channels, leading to action potentials or muscle contractions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mechanosensory receptors are specialized epithelial cells that respond to light stimuli like photons and wavelengths. They transduce these stimuli into electrical signals by activating photopigment cascades, leading to graded potentials or visual signals.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Mechanosensory receptors are specialized immune cells that respond to inflammatory stimuli like cytokines and antigens. They transduce these stimuli into electrical signals by activating intracellular signaling pathways, leading to immune responses or pain sensations."

                        "goodAnswer": "Neuromuscular spindles are stretch receptors within skeletal muscles that monitor muscle length and rate of change in length. They consist of intrafusal muscle fibers innervated by sensory (Ia and II) and motor (gamma) neurons, providing proprioceptive feedback and regulating muscle tone.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Neuromuscular spindles are tension receptors within tendons that monitor muscle force and rate of change in force. They consist of extrafusal muscle fibers innervated by Golgi tendon organs and alpha motor neurons, providing feedback for muscle contraction strength.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Neuromuscular spindles are pain receptors within muscle fascia that detect muscle damage and inflammation. They consist of nociceptive nerve endings innervated by C fibers and substance P, initiating pain reflexes and protective responses.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Neuromuscular spindles are chemoreceptors within muscle blood vessels that monitor muscle oxygen and CO2 levels. They consist of carotid bodies and aortic bodies innervated by autonomic nerves, regulating muscle blood flow and respiration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Neuromuscular spindles are thermoreceptors within muscle skin that detect muscle temperature and heat dissipation. They consist of free nerve endings and sweat glands innervated by sympathetic nerves, controlling muscle thermoregulation and sweating."

                        "question": "What are the roles of intrafusal and extrafusal muscle fibers within a neuromuscular spindle, and how do they contribute to muscle proprioception?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Intrafusal fibers within the spindle detect muscle stretch, and their sensory neurons (Ia and II) transmit proprioceptive information to the CNS. Extrafusal fibers are the main force-generating muscle fibers outside the spindle, and their contraction is adjusted based on spindle feedback to maintain muscle tone and posture.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Intrafusal fibers are contractile fibers within the spindle that generate muscle force, and their motor neurons (alpha) initiate muscle contraction. Extrafusal fibers are sensory fibers outside the spindle that detect muscle tension, and their sensory neurons (Ib) transmit force information to the CNS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Intrafusal fibers are inhibitory fibers within the spindle that reduce muscle excitability, and their interneurons modulate muscle reflexes. Extrafusal fibers are excitatory fibers outside the spindle that increase muscle excitability, and their neurotransmitters enhance muscle activation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Intrafusal fibers are structural fibers within the spindle that provide support to muscle tissue, and their connective tissue elements maintain muscle integrity. Extrafusal fibers are metabolic fibers outside the spindle that regulate muscle energy production, and their enzymes control muscle metabolism.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Intrafusal fibers are immune cells within the spindle that protect muscle fibers from infection, and their lymphocytes initiate muscle inflammation. Extrafusal fibers are repair cells outside the spindle that regenerate damaged muscle tissue, and their stem cells promote muscle healing."

                        "question": "Explain the function of gamma motor neurons in regulating the sensitivity of neuromuscular spindles.",
                        "goodAnswer": "Gamma motor neurons innervate the contractile ends of intrafusal fibers, causing them to contract and increasing tension on the spindle's sensory region. This 'resets' the spindle sensitivity, allowing it to remain sensitive to stretch even when the whole muscle shortens during contraction, maintaining proprioceptive feedback across different muscle lengths.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Gamma motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, causing them to contract and increasing muscle force. This enhances overall muscle strength and power, allowing for greater force generation during voluntary movements, independent of spindle sensitivity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Gamma motor neurons innervate Golgi tendon organs, causing them to increase tension on tendons and inhibiting muscle contraction. This protects muscles from excessive force and prevents muscle damage, reducing spindle sensitivity during strong contractions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Gamma motor neurons innervate sensory neurons within the spindle, causing them to decrease their firing rate and reducing proprioceptive feedback. This dampens muscle reflexes and reduces muscle tone, limiting spindle sensitivity to rapid stretches only.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gamma motor neurons innervate blood vessels within the muscle, causing them to dilate and increasing blood flow to muscle tissue. This enhances muscle oxygen supply and nutrient delivery, improving muscle endurance but not directly affecting spindle sensitivity."
