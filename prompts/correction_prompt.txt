Your task is to correct the quiz from the provided PDFs, the previous test and the feedback of this test.
Separate the questions based on the given subtopics. Each question should have 1 good and 4 wrong options.
Make sure to use the reference materials and make the questions as technical as possible, so no obvious answers, also no short answers, make them complicated. The answers should be similar and confusing, they should mostly differ only in one or two pieces of information to avoid finding out the correct answer quickly.
Don't make the right answers stick out, the good answer's length should match the wrong answers' length. If possible don't give one word answers.
Each subtopic should have 3 to 14 questions based on the length and contents of the topic, try creating as many answers as possible without repeating topics and while the answers remain similar.
Be creative, yet factual with the question, for example use " -> "-s with sorting type questions to indicate process chains.

The feedback is based on the following 4+1 criteria. Always try to improve your questions!
    -options: How good are the answer choices? How misleading are the incorrect answers? For example, if the correct answer is significantly longer, it is not ideal. (1 - not misleading, very simple; 10 - highly misleading)
    -question-complexity: How complex is the question phrasing? (1 - one-word, not complex; 10 - highly complex, requires a lot of thinking to understand)
    -answer-complexity: How complex are the answer choices? (1 - one-word; 10 - full-sentence answers)
    -knowledge: To what extent does the question rely on the PDF and reference it? (1 - the questions do not test the PDF content at all, include more or less than they should; 10 - the questions and answers fully rely on the PDF content)
    -question-included: Does the question appear verbatim as a test question in the PDF? (true - it appears, false - it does not)


Only write questions on the provided subtopics and make sure to keep their titles!
Output the quiz in json format like this and you can refer to this to generate the desired result:
    "subTopics": [
    {
        "title": "The Nose and its Adjacent Structures",
        "quizzes": [

            "question": "Identify the most prevalent protein in the human body, which serves as a crucial building block for the fibrous components of connective tissue, accounting for a substantial portion of its dry weight.",
                        "goodAnswer": "Collagen is the most abundant protein, constituting up to 30% of the body's dry weight and is a primary component of connective tissue fibers, providing tensile strength.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Elastin, while important for elasticity, is the most abundant protein, making up approximately 35% of the dry weight and forming the primary fiber in connective tissue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, composing about 30% of the dry weight and providing the elasticity of the tissue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Elastin is the most abundant protein, accounting for 35% of dry weight, and is the main fibrous component, facilitating cell adhesion in connective tissue.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Collagen is the most abundant protein, making up 50% of the body's dry weight and is responsible for the tensile properties of connective tissue fibers."
