                        "wrongAnswer_1": "PCI (stenting) is exclusively indicated for left main coronary artery stenosis due to higher efficacy in severe CAD and superior long-term patency rates compared to CABG; CABG (surgical bypass) is reserved for single vessel disease in young, low-risk patients seeking cosmetic advantages and shorter hospital stays.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "PCI (stenting) is contraindicated in diabetic patients and those with multivessel disease due to significantly higher risks of restenosis and stent thrombosis; CABG (surgical bypass) is the primary and universally recommended treatment for all forms of coronary artery disease, regardless of severity or anatomical complexity, offering universally superior outcomes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "PCI (stenting) has no role in chronic stable angina management and is primarily used for acute coronary syndromes to restore immediate flow; CABG (surgical bypass) is used for primary prevention of CAD in asymptomatic individuals with multiple risk factors, providing excellent long-term protection against future cardiac events.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "PCI (stenting) is not a revascularization strategy but solely a diagnostic tool to assess coronary artery stenosis severity; CABG (surgical bypass) is exclusively used for peripheral artery disease to improve limb perfusion and has no application in the management of coronary artery disease or angina symptoms."
