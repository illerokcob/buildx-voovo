                        "goodAnswer": "Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) uniquely arises from intermediate trophoblast cells of the placental implantation site, which contrasts with choriocarcinoma's origin from cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, leading to PSTT's distinct hormone production and slower growth.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "PSTT originates from syncytiotrophoblast cells, similar to choriocarcinoma, but unlike other GTDs, PSTT uniquely features rapid proliferation and high hCG secretion due to its exclusive syncytiotrophoblastic derivation within the placental bed.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "PSTT is derived from cytotrophoblast cells of the chorionic villi, a characteristic shared with hydatidiform moles, yet PSTT diverges in its aggressive invasion and lower hCG production because of altered cytotrophoblastic differentiation pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "PSTT arises from villous trophoblast, the same cellular precursor as invasive mole, distinguishing itself through enhanced vascular invasion and elevated hCG levels stemming from its specific villous trophoblastic lineage within the placental site.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "PSTT is uniquely derived from extravillous trophoblast, differentiating it from all other GTDs which originate from villous components, and this extravillous origin accounts for PSTT's high metastatic potential and resistance to chemotherapy."

                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The established standard of care for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer is hormonal therapy, utilizing aromatase inhibitors and anti-estrogens to target estrogen receptors on tumor cells, aiming to induce tumor regression and achieve durable disease stabilization in hormone-responsive cervical cancers.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "For recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the primary treatment modality is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, aimed at replacing the patient's immune system with donor-derived immune cells to eradicate residual cancer cells and achieve long-term remission or potential cure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer is primarily managed with gene therapy approaches, utilizing viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes directly to cancer cells, inducing cancer-specific cell death or promoting cellular differentiation, offering a potentially curative therapeutic strategy."
