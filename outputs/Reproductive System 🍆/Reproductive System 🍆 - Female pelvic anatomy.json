                        "goodAnswer": "Located within the myometrium, arcuate arteries serve as the origin for radial arteries, which subsequently penetrate into the endometrium to vascularize both the basalis and functionalis layers, ensuring nutrient supply.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Situated in the perimetrium, arcuate arteries are responsible for directly supplying blood to the functionalis layer of the endometrium, while the basalis layer is vascularized by basal arterioles originating from the radial arteries.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Positioned within the endometrium, arcuate arteries are the primary source of blood supply to the myometrium and perimetrium, with minimal contribution to the superficial functionalis layer during the menstrual cycle.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Found in the basalis layer of the endometrium, arcuate arteries provide exclusive blood supply to the basalis layer itself and give rise to spiral arterioles that vascularize the myometrium during the proliferative phase.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Located in the cervix, arcuate arteries supply blood to the lower uterine segment and the cervical stroma, with no direct contribution to the vascularization of either the basalis or functionalis layers of the endometrium."

                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The myometrium, specifically its superficial subendometrial zone, experiences cyclical changes including the detachment of its inner lining, which results in menstrual flow and uterine involution.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The perimetrium, particularly the serosal layer adjacent to the endometrial surface, is subject to cyclical shedding and regeneration, contributing to menstrual discharge and uterine serosal remodeling.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Abnormal uterine bleeding due to ovulatory dysfunction typically arises from prolonged, unopposed estrogen exposure resulting from anovulation, which leads to endometrial hyperplasia, instability, and subsequent irregular, unpredictable bleeding patterns.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with ovulatory dysfunction is primarily caused by excessive progesterone secretion in the absence of ovulation, leading to endometrial atrophy, fragility, and consequent irregular shedding and bleeding episodes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Ovulatory dysfunction-related AUB originates from synchronized and excessive endometrial shedding due to increased prostaglandin production during anovulatory cycles, causing heavy and prolonged menstrual-like bleeding.",
