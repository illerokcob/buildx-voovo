                        "goodAnswer": "Intraperitoneal organs are almost completely enveloped by visceral peritoneum, are mobile, and are suspended by mesenteries within the peritoneal cavity, allowing for significant movement, whereas retroperitoneal organs are located behind the parietal peritoneum, are relatively fixed, and are only partially covered by peritoneum anteriorly, lacking a mesentery.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Intraperitoneal organs are located behind the parietal peritoneum, are relatively fixed, and are only partially covered by peritoneum posteriorly, lacking a mesentery, whereas retroperitoneal organs are almost completely enveloped by visceral peritoneum, are mobile, and are suspended by mesenteries within the peritoneal cavity, allowing for significant movement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Intraperitoneal organs are completely devoid of peritoneal covering, are immobile, and are attached directly to the anterior abdominal wall, whereas retroperitoneal organs are entirely enveloped by parietal peritoneum, are highly mobile, and are suspended by ligaments within the retroperitoneal space, allowing for extensive movement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Intraperitoneal organs are partially covered by parietal peritoneum on their posterior surface, are semi-mobile, and are fixed to the posterior abdominal wall by adhesions, whereas retroperitoneal organs are entirely enveloped by visceral peritoneum, are completely immobile, and are embedded within the peritoneal layers, restricting any movement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Intraperitoneal organs are almost completely enveloped by parietal peritoneum, are immobile, and are suspended by ligaments within the retroperitoneal space, restricting movement, whereas retroperitoneal organs are located within the peritoneal cavity, are mobile, and are only partially covered by visceral peritoneum anteriorly, possessing a mesentery."
