                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Gamma motor neurons innervate extrafusal fibers, directly controlling muscle contraction force and velocity, determining the overall strength of muscle actions and postural adjustments.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Gamma motor neurons innervate Golgi tendon organs, regulating muscle tension and preventing excessive force generation, ensuring muscle protection and smooth movements.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Gamma motor neurons innervate Pacinian corpuscles, modulating vibration sensitivity and adapting rapidly to changes in muscle pressure, affecting fine motor control and coordination.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Gamma motor neurons innervate free nerve endings in muscles, regulating pain and temperature sensation, contributing to nociceptive reflexes and thermoregulation in muscle tissue."
