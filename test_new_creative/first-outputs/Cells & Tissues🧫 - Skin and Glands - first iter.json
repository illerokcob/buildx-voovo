                        "question": "Which hormonal changes are primarily responsible for the development and functional maturation of the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Estrogen and progesterone stimulate ductal and alveolar development during pregnancy, while prolactin is crucial for initiating and maintaining milk production, and oxytocin triggers milk ejection during lactation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Testosterone and growth hormone are primary hormones for mammary gland development, stimulating cell proliferation and gland enlargement during puberty, and maintaining gland size and function throughout adulthood.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Cortisol and insulin are crucial hormones for mammary gland maturation, regulating glucose metabolism and energy storage in mammary tissues during pregnancy and lactation to support milk synthesis and secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Thyroid hormones and adrenaline primarily control mammary gland function, stimulating metabolic activity and milk duct contraction during lactation to enhance milk flow and nutrient delivery to the infant.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Melatonin and serotonin are essential hormones for mammary gland development, regulating circadian rhythms and sleep cycles which indirectly influence milk production and infant feeding patterns during lactation."

                        "question": "What is the process of milk production (lactogenesis) in the mammary gland, and what are the major components of breast milk that provide nutrition and immune support to the newborn?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Lactogenesis involves prolactin-stimulated synthesis of milk components like lactose, proteins, and lipids within alveolar cells, followed by secretion into ducts. Breast milk contains carbohydrates (lactose), proteins (casein, whey), fats, vitamins, minerals, and immunoglobulins (IgA) providing nutrition and passive immunity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Lactogenesis is the process of converting stored adipose tissue into milk through lipolysis and fatty acid synthesis in mammary adipocytes. Breast milk primarily consists of triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and fat-soluble vitamins, mainly providing energy and insulation to the newborn.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Lactogenesis involves the filtration of blood plasma by mammary capillaries and concentration of electrolytes and water to form milk. Breast milk mainly contains water, sodium, potassium, chloride, and trace minerals, primarily providing hydration and electrolyte balance to the infant.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Lactogenesis is the process of breaking down glycogen stored in mammary gland cells and converting it to glucose, which is then secreted as milk. Breast milk mainly contains glucose, fructose, sucrose, and simple sugars, primarily providing quick energy and sweetness to the newborn.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Lactogenesis involves the synthesis of collagen and elastin fibers within mammary fibroblasts, which are then secreted as milk to provide structural proteins. Breast milk mainly contains collagen, elastin, keratin, and structural proteins, primarily providing building blocks for tissue growth and development in the infant."
