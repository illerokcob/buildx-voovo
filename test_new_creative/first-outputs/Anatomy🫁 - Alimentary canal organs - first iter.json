                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The divisions of the large intestine, in order of flow, are the pylorus, fundus, body, and antrum, describing the regions of the stomach that precede the large intestine, and are not part of the large intestine itself.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The anatomical parts of the large intestine, from beginning to end, are the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, providing a broader overview of the digestive tract but not detailing the specific regions within the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The regions of the large intestine, in sequence, are the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, outlining the upper digestive tract before reaching the large intestine, and not listing the regions within the large intestine."

                        "question": "Explain the structural features that distinguish the large intestine from the small intestine, focusing on taeniae coli, haustra, and omental appendices.",
                        "goodAnswer": "The large intestine is distinguished by taeniae coli (longitudinal muscle bands), haustra (sacculations between taeniae), and omental appendices (fat-filled pouches), features absent in the small intestine, facilitating segmental contractions and water absorption.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The large intestine is characterized by villi (finger-like projections), microvilli (apical membrane extensions), and plicae circulares (circular folds), structural adaptations primarily found in the small intestine for enhancing nutrient absorption, not in the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The large intestine is defined by gastric pits (mucosal indentations), gastric glands (secretory units), and rugae (temporary folds), features typical of the stomach mucosa for acid secretion and mechanical mixing, not found in the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The large intestine is identified by alveoli (air sacs), bronchioles (air passages), and pleura (membrane lining), structures of the respiratory system for gas exchange, unrelated to the anatomical features of the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The large intestine is marked by nephrons (functional units), glomeruli (filtration units), and tubules (reabsorption channels), components of the kidney for blood filtration and waste excretion, not characteristic of the large intestine structure."

                        "question": "Describe the primary function of the large intestine in digestion and absorption.",
                        "goodAnswer": "The primary function of the large intestine is to absorb water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter, compacting it into feces, while also hosting gut microbiota that ferment undigested material and synthesize certain vitamins, playing a key role in water balance and waste elimination.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The primary function of the large intestine is to digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats using enzymes secreted by its mucosal glands, and to absorb the resulting monomers directly into the bloodstream through its extensive network of villi, acting as a major digestive and absorptive organ for macronutrients.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary function of the large intestine is to secrete bile and pancreatic juice into its lumen, aiding in the emulsification and digestion of fats, and to absorb lipids and fat-soluble vitamins through lacteals located within its villi, serving as the principal site of fat digestion and absorption.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The primary function of the large intestine is to mechanically digest food through powerful peristaltic contractions and segmentation movements, breaking down large food particles into smaller fragments, and to absorb minerals and trace elements directly across its mucosal lining, focusing on mechanical digestion and mineral absorption.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The primary function of the large intestine is to filter blood and remove metabolic wastes in the form of urine, regulating blood volume and composition, and to reabsorb water and electrolytes back into the bloodstream from the filtrate, acting as a crucial organ for waste excretion and fluid balance regulation."
