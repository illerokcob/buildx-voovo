                        "goodAnswer": "Key organic components include \u03b1-amylase (digestion of carbohydrates), lysozyme and lactoferrin (antimicrobial), mucins (lubrication and protection), and proline-rich proteins (calcium binding and enamel protection); each contributes distinctly to oral homeostasis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Key organic components are pepsin (digestion of proteins), defensins and immunoglobulins (tissue repair), collagen (structural support), and fibronectin (cell adhesion); collectively promoting tissue regeneration and structural integrity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Key organic components include lipase (digestion of fats), peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (pro-oxidant), albumin (nutrient transport), and globulins (hormone binding); primarily involved in nutrient metabolism and hormonal regulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Key organic components are cellulase (digestion of cellulose), interferon and cytokines (pro-inflammatory), keratin (epithelial barrier), and elastin (tissue elasticity); largely mediating inflammatory responses and structural flexibility.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Key organic components include nuclease (digestion of nucleic acids), complement proteins (immune activation), fibrinogen (clotting), and actin (cellular motility); mainly functioning in hemostasis and immune surveillance."

                        "question": "Explain the role of salivary proteins, specifically mucins, in protecting the oral mucosa and maintaining oral lubrication, contrasting their structural features and functions with other salivary proteins.",
                        "goodAnswer": "Mucins are large, heavily glycosylated proteins that form a gel-like layer on the mucosa, providing lubrication, a barrier against pathogens, and preventing dehydration; other salivary proteins, like amylase or lysozyme, are smaller, globular proteins with enzymatic or antimicrobial roles, not primarily for lubrication.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Mucins are small, non-glycosylated proteins that enhance salivary viscosity by increasing water content, primarily functioning to dilute ingested toxins; other salivary proteins, like mucin-related proteins, are larger and provide antimicrobial defense.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Mucins are fibrous proteins forming a rigid meshwork in saliva, providing structural support to the oral cavity; other salivary proteins, like mucin-binding proteins, act as receptors for mucins on epithelial cells, mediating cell adhesion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mucins are lipid-rich proteins that create a hydrophobic layer on the mucosa, preventing water loss and acting as a sealant against bacterial invasion; other salivary proteins, like lipid-associated proteins, facilitate lipid digestion in the oral cavity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Mucins are nucleic acid-based polymers that enhance salivary buffering capacity by binding to hydrogen ions, primarily functioning to regulate oral pH; other salivary proteins, like nucleic acid-binding proteins, control gene expression in salivary glands."

                        "goodAnswer": "Lysozyme hydrolyzes peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls, causing lysis; lactoferrin binds iron, depriving bacteria of this essential nutrient and also disrupting bacterial membranes; both act synergistically to inhibit bacterial growth and biofilm formation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Lysozyme inhibits viral replication by blocking viral entry into host cells; lactoferrin activates complement pathways to enhance viral clearance; both are primarily antiviral components of saliva.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Lysozyme promotes fungal growth by providing nutrients for fungal metabolism; lactoferrin stimulates fungal spore germination and adhesion to oral surfaces; both contribute to oral mycobiome establishment.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Lysozyme neutralizes bacterial toxins by binding to exotoxins and endotoxins; lactoferrin enhances bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces, promoting commensal bacterial colonization; both regulate oral microbiome composition.",
