                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Holocrine secretion involves product accumulation within the cell until cell rupture and disintegration release the entire cellular contents including secretory products and cell debris, leading to cell destruction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Autocrine secretion involves product release that acts on the same cell that secreted it, regulating cellular functions and responses through self-stimulation or feedback mechanisms within individual secretory cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Paracrine secretion involves product release that affects neighboring cells within the immediate vicinity through diffusion across the extracellular space, influencing local tissue environment and intercellular communication."

                        "goodAnswer": "Holocrine secretion is defined by the complete destruction of the secretory cell, which accumulates secretory products internally and then ruptures to release both products and cellular debris, necessitating cell replacement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Merocrine secretion is defined by the release of secretory products along with a portion of the apical cytoplasm, leading to partial cell loss and requiring cell regeneration for continued secretory activity and tissue maintenance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Apocrine secretion is defined by the expulsion of secretory products via exocytosis, where secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to discharge their contents without causing cell damage or cellular loss.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Paracrine secretion is defined by the diffusion of secretory products to act on adjacent target cells within the immediate vicinity, influencing local tissue environment and requiring close cell proximity for effective signaling.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Autocrine secretion is defined by the action of secretory products on the cell that produced them, regulating cellular functions through internal feedback loops and influencing individual cell behavior and responsiveness."
