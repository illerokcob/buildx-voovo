                        "goodAnswer": "Dense regular connective tissue has parallel collagen fibers providing high tensile strength in one direction, found in tendons and ligaments; dense irregular connective tissue has randomly oriented collagen fibers providing resistance to tension in multiple directions, found in dermis and organ capsules, offering multidirectional support.",

                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Dense regular connective tissue is composed of reticular fibers forming delicate networks, found in lymphoid tissues; dense irregular connective tissue is made of adipose tissue storing energy, found in subcutaneous layers, with no structural fiber component.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Dense regular connective tissue has a high proportion of ground substance and low fiber density, providing flexibility and hydration; dense irregular connective tissue has minimal ground substance and high fiber density, providing rigidity and compressive strength, with reversed fiber arrangement.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Adipose tissue is specialized for lipid storage, insulation, and endocrine function; WAT is unilocular, primarily for energy storage; BAT is multilocular, contains mitochondria with uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) for thermogenesis, found in newborns and hibernating animals, with distinct metabolic roles.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Adipose tissue is primarily involved in collagen synthesis and ECM production, providing structural support and tensile strength; WAT is composed of reticular fibers forming networks, BAT is made of elastic fibers providing elasticity, both primarily structural tissues.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Adipose tissue functions as a pigment-producing tissue providing coloration and UV protection; WAT produces melanin for skin pigmentation, BAT produces hemoglobin for oxygen transport, both mainly involved in tissue coloration and gas exchange.",
