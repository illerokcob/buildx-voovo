                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); Risk factors: HLA mismatch degree, pre-transplant sensitization, genetic predisposition, unrelated to infectious agents but to dysregulated immunity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Malignancies (PTLD, skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma); Risk factors: chronic inflammation, immunosuppression promoting viral oncogenesis (EBV, HPV), genetic susceptibility, focusing on oncological rather than infectious complications.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Metabolic disorders (diabetes, hyperlipidemia), cardiovascular disease; Risk factors: immunosuppressant-induced metabolic side effects, sedentary lifestyle, pre-existing comorbidities, highlighting metabolic and cardiovascular issues post-transplant.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Surgical complications (vascular thrombosis, anastomotic leak), primary non-function; Risk factors: donor organ quality, cold ischemia time, surgical technique, recipient comorbidities, emphasizing procedural and organ-related failures rather than infections."

                        "question": "Explain the pathogenesis and clinical features of Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) in transplant recipients.",
                        "goodAnswer": "PTLD is lymphoid proliferation due to EBV reactivation/de novo infection under immunosuppression; presents as lymphadenopathy, fever, B symptoms, can be polymorphic or monomorphic lymphoma, risk highest in EBV-seronegative recipients receiving organs from seropositive donors (D+/R-).",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "PTLD is caused by chronic rejection leading to graft infiltration by lymphocytes and fibrosis, mimicking lymphoma; presents with graft dysfunction, proteinuria, hypertension, associated with chronic antibody-mediated rejection and graft vasculopathy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "PTLD is a form of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting lymphoid tissues, caused by donor T-cell infiltration into recipient lymph nodes; presents with fever, rash, diarrhea, liver dysfunction, seen predominantly in bone marrow transplant recipients.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "PTLD is an autoimmune disease triggered by transplantation, leading to autoantibody production and lymphoid hyperplasia; presents with fatigue, joint pain, mucosal ulcers, resembles systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis post-transplant.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "PTLD is a drug-induced toxicity of immunosuppressants, particularly calcineurin inhibitors, causing benign lymphoid hyperplasia; presents with gingival hyperplasia, tremor, nephrotoxicity, resolves upon dose reduction or drug withdrawal."
