                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are primarily responsible for both systemic inflammation and fibrosis in condition Z, acting as direct fibrogenic factors and potent inducers of acute phase reactants, directly correlating with the severity of tissue damage and systemic symptoms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) superfamily cytokines are the principal mediators of both inflammation and fibrosis in condition Z, inducing direct cellular cytotoxicity and stimulating fibroblast proliferation, thus directly driving tissue destruction and scar formation in affected organs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Interferon (IFN) family cytokines are crucial in the dual pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis, primarily by activating macrophages and inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in affected tissues, leading to both chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis in condition Z.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Chemokine families, particularly CXC chemokines, are the central drivers of inflammation and fibrosis, by recruiting immune cells to sites of tissue injury and directly stimulating collagen synthesis by fibroblasts, thus mediating both inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic remodeling in condition Z."
