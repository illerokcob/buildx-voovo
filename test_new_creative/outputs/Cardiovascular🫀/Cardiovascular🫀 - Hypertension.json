                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The primary therapeutic goal for managing essential hypertension is to achieve a blood pressure target of below 140/90 mm Hg for all adult hypertensive patients, primarily minimizing the incidence of acute hypertensive crises and immediate cerebrovascular events but less aggressively targeting long-term risk.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary therapeutic goal for managing essential hypertension is to maintain a systolic blood pressure consistently between 120-139 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure between 70-89 mm Hg for optimal overall cardiovascular health and physiological function across diverse patient populations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The primary therapeutic goal for managing essential hypertension is to lower systolic blood pressure to below 150 mm Hg specifically in individuals over 60 years of age, pragmatically balancing intensive blood pressure control with minimizing potential medication-related adverse effects in older adults.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The primary therapeutic goal for managing essential hypertension is to normalize blood pressure readings to below 120/70 mm Hg in all hypertensive patients regardless of age or comorbidities, aiming for blood pressure levels ideally comparable to healthy normotensive individuals but potentially increasing risk of adverse events."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Implementing a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, emphasizing increased protein intake and restricted carbohydrate consumption, is a crucial lifestyle modification for comprehensive hypertension management, primarily promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity to secondarily reduce blood pressure levels.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Following a ketogenic diet, characterized by very low carbohydrate intake and high fat consumption to induce metabolic ketosis, is a primary lifestyle intervention strategy for hypertension, primarily inducing ketosis and lowering blood pressure primarily through metabolic alterations and weight reduction.",
