                        "goodAnswer": "Amelogenesis involves pre-ameloblasts differentiating into secretory ameloblasts that secrete an initial partially mineralized enamel matrix rich in amelogenin; maturation ameloblasts then remove water and organic material, deposit inorganic minerals, and secrete enamelin for crystal growth and hardening, completing enamel maturation.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Sympathetic stimulation, mainly via acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors, produces a large volume of watery saliva similar to parasympathetic stimulation, but with higher electrolyte concentration; only Ca2+ signaling is involved.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Sympathetic stimulation, mainly via epinephrine acting on nicotinic receptors, completely inhibits saliva secretion by closing ion channels in acinar cells; neither cAMP nor Ca2+ signaling is activated.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Sympathetic stimulation, mainly via dopamine acting on dopamine receptors, produces a large volume of highly viscous, mucus-rich saliva, in contrast to parasympathetic stimulation which produces serous saliva; only cGMP signaling is involved.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Sympathetic stimulation, mainly via serotonin acting on serotonin receptors, has no effect on saliva volume but increases the concentration of antimicrobial proteins in saliva; only IP3 signaling is involved."

                        "question": "Describe the influence of salivary flow rate on the ionic composition of saliva, particularly concerning sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate concentrations, and explain the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for these flow-dependent changes.",
                        "goodAnswer": "At low flow rates, saliva becomes more hypotonic with lower Na+ and Cl- concentrations and higher K+ and HCO3- concentrations due to increased ductal modification time, allowing for greater reabsorption of Na+ and Cl- and secretion of K+ and HCO3-; At high flow rates, ductal modification is reduced, leading to saliva composition closer to primary saliva, with higher Na+ and Cl- and lower K+ and HCO3- concentrations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Salivary flow rate has no significant impact on ionic composition; saliva maintains a constant isotonic composition regardless of flow rate due to fixed transport capacities of acinar and ductal cells; ionic concentrations are primarily determined by dietary intake of electrolytes, not flow rate.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "At low flow rates, saliva becomes more hypertonic with higher Na+ and Cl- concentrations and lower K+ and HCO3- concentrations due to increased acinar cell activity, leading to greater secretion of Na+ and Cl- and reduced reabsorption of K+ and HCO3-; At high flow rates, saliva becomes hypotonic due to reduced acinar cell secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Salivary flow rate primarily affects water content, not ionic composition; at high flow rates, saliva is more watery with diluted electrolytes, and at low flow rates, saliva is less watery but ionic concentrations remain relatively stable; flow rate regulates saliva volume, not ionic balance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "At low flow rates, saliva becomes alkaline with increased HCO3- and decreased H+ concentrations due to enhanced buffering capacity; at high flow rates, saliva becomes acidic with decreased HCO3- and increased H+ concentrations due to reduced buffering time; flow rate regulates saliva pH, not necessarily other ionic concentrations."

                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Salivary proteins primarily serve as enzymes for lipid metabolism (lipase, phospholipase), carbohydrate synthesis (glycosyltransferases, glycogen synthase), nucleic acid degradation (DNase, RNase), and vitamin synthesis (folate reductase, biotin synthase); antimicrobial, lubricating, and tissue protective roles are secondary or non-existent."

                        "goodAnswer": "MG1 mucins are large, gel-forming, heavily O-glycosylated, providing bulk lubrication, forming a protective barrier against dehydration and pathogens, and interacting with microorganisms non-specifically; MG2 mucins are smaller, soluble, less glycosylated, contributing to thin lubrication, acting as a lubricant between surfaces, and potentially involved in specific microbial interactions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "MG1 mucins are small, soluble proteins, heavily N-glycosylated, primarily functioning in enzyme transport and nutrient delivery within saliva; MG2 mucins are large, fibrous proteins, poorly glycosylated, providing structural support to the oral mucosa and facilitating cell adhesion, but not involved in lubrication.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Both MG1 and MG2 mucins are identical in size and glycosylation, both forming a viscous gel layer and providing the same functions in lubrication and protection; their distinction is based solely on their location in different salivary glands, not on structural or functional differences.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "MG1 mucins are lipid-rich proteins, forming a hydrophobic layer on the mucosa, preventing water loss and acting as a sealant against bacterial invasion; MG2 mucins are nucleic acid-based polymers, enhancing salivary buffering capacity by binding to hydrogen ions and regulating oral pH, not involved in lubrication directly.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "MG1 mucins are fibrous proteins, forming a rigid meshwork in saliva, providing structural support to the oral cavity and resisting mechanical stress; MG2 mucins are globular proteins, primarily functioning as antimicrobial agents, directly targeting and killing microorganisms without lubricating properties."
