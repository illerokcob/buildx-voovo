                        "goodAnswer": "The large intestine regions, in order of chyme passage, are the cecum (with appendix), ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal, primarily involved in water absorption and fecal formation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The segments of the large intestine, sequentially arranged, are the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon, representing a mix of small and large intestinal components, incorrectly ordering the segments and including small intestinal parts.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The divisions of the large intestine, in order of flow, are the pylorus, fundus, body, and antrum, describing the regions of the stomach that precede the large intestine, and are not part of the large intestine itself.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The anatomical parts of the large intestine, from beginning to end, are the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, providing a broader overview of the digestive tract but not detailing the specific regions within the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The regions of the large intestine, in sequence, are the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, outlining the upper digestive tract before reaching the large intestine, and not listing the regions within the large intestine."

                        "question": "Explain the structural features that distinguish the large intestine from the small intestine, focusing on taeniae coli, haustra, and omental appendices.",
                        "goodAnswer": "The large intestine is distinguished by taeniae coli (longitudinal muscle bands), haustra (sacculations between taeniae), and omental appendices (fat-filled pouches), features absent in the small intestine, facilitating segmental contractions and water absorption.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The large intestine is characterized by villi (finger-like projections), microvilli (apical membrane extensions), and plicae circulares (circular folds), structural adaptations primarily found in the small intestine for enhancing nutrient absorption, not in the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The large intestine is defined by gastric pits (mucosal indentations), gastric glands (secretory units), and rugae (temporary folds), features typical of the stomach mucosa for acid secretion and mechanical mixing, not found in the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The large intestine is identified by alveoli (air sacs), bronchioles (air passages), and pleura (membrane lining), structures of the respiratory system for gas exchange, unrelated to the anatomical features of the large intestine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The large intestine is marked by nephrons (functional units), glomeruli (filtration units), and tubules (reabsorption channels), components of the kidney for blood filtration and waste excretion, not characteristic of the large intestine structure."

                        "question": "Describe the histological characteristics of the large intestinal mucosa, differentiating it from the small intestinal mucosa in terms of villi and cell types.",
                        "goodAnswer": "The large intestinal mucosa is characterized by a smooth surface lacking villi and plicae circulares, featuring deep intestinal glands (crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn) rich in goblet cells and absorptive colonocytes, but with fewer enteroendocrine cells and Paneth cells compared to the small intestinal mucosa which possesses villi and a different cellular composition.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The large intestinal mucosa exhibits prominent villi and plicae circulares, similar to the small intestine, and is lined by enterocytes specialized for nutrient absorption, goblet cells for mucus secretion, and Paneth cells for antimicrobial defense, mirroring small intestinal histology.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The large intestinal mucosa is histologically identical to the gastric mucosa, featuring gastric pits and glands containing parietal cells, chief cells, and mucous neck cells, specialized for acid and enzyme secretion rather than water absorption and fecal formation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The large intestinal mucosa is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, similar to the esophagus, providing a protective barrier against abrasion and mechanical stress, with minimal secretory or absorptive functions and lacking villi or crypts.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The large intestinal mucosa is characterized by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells, similar to the respiratory mucosa, featuring cilia for mucociliary clearance and goblet cells for mucus production, unrelated to the absorptive functions of the large intestine."
