                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hemidesmosomes provide strong cell-cell adhesion between adjacent epithelial cells, similar to desmosomes, but they are located at the apical surface and resist lateral forces, maintaining epithelial sheet integrity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Hemidesmosomes facilitate intercellular communication by forming channels for ion and small molecule passage between epithelial cells, analogous to gap junctions but with greater selectivity and regulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Hemidesmosomes regulate paracellular permeability by forming tight seals between epithelial cells, similar to tight junctions, but they are localized to the basal surface and control basal-lateral diffusion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Hemidesmosomes mediate transient cell-cell interactions, similar to selectin-mediated adhesion, but they are involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling, rather than stable adhesion in stationary epithelia."

                        "goodAnswer": "Exocrine glands secrete substances into ducts that empty onto an epithelial surface or into a lumen, acting locally, while endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream to act on distant target cells throughout the body.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Exocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream for systemic effects, whereas endocrine glands secrete products into ducts for localized effects on epithelial surfaces or lumens.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Exocrine glands are characterized by secreting lipid-soluble hormones that diffuse across cell membranes, while endocrine glands secrete water-soluble products that require membrane receptors for cellular entry.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Exocrine glands primarily secrete enzymes and digestive juices into the gastrointestinal tract, while endocrine glands secrete neurotransmitters that act on adjacent nerve cells and synapses within the nervous system.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Exocrine glands are composed of nervous tissue and secrete electrical signals for rapid communication, whereas endocrine glands are epithelial tissues that secrete chemical signals for slower, sustained communication."

                        "goodAnswer": "Merocrine secretion involves exocytosis, where secretory vesicles fuse with the apical plasma membrane and release their contents without loss of cytoplasm or damage to the secretory cell, preserving cell integrity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Merocrine secretion involves holocrine release, where the entire secretory cell ruptures and disintegrates to release its accumulated products, leading to cell destruction and replacement for continued secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Merocrine secretion involves apocrine release, where the apical portion of the secretory cell, containing accumulated products, is pinched off and released, causing partial cell loss but preserving basal cell components.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Merocrine secretion involves diffusion of secretory products directly across the plasma membrane, without vesicle involvement, relying on concentration gradients and membrane permeability for product release.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Merocrine secretion involves transcytosis, where secretory products are internalized into vesicles at the basal membrane, transported across the cytoplasm, and released at the apical membrane through exocytosis."

                        "goodAnswer": "Apocrine secretion involves the release of secretory products along with some apical cytoplasm, where the apical portion of the cell pinches off, carrying the secretion, resulting in some cellular loss but not cell destruction, seen in mammary and some sweat glands.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Apocrine secretion is similar to merocrine secretion, involving exocytosis of secretory vesicles without any cellular loss or damage; it\u2019s the most common mode of secretion in most exocrine glands.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Apocrine secretion is identical to holocrine secretion, where the entire cell ruptures and releases its contents; it leads to complete cell destruction and requires cell regeneration for continued secretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Apocrine secretion involves diffusion of secretory products across the cell membrane, similar to merocrine secretion, but it is limited to lipid-soluble substances and occurs in sebaceous glands.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Apocrine secretion involves transcytosis of secretory products across the cell, from basal to apical surface, without any cellular loss or damage, primarily found in endocrine glands secreting peptide hormones."

                        "goodAnswer": "Holocrine secretion involves the accumulation of secretory products within the cell, followed by cell rupture and disintegration, releasing both the product and cellular debris; the entire cell is lost and is replaced by new cells, characteristic of sebaceous glands.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Holocrine secretion is similar to merocrine secretion, where secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release products without cell damage; it\u2019s a conservative process preserving cell integrity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Holocrine secretion resembles apocrine secretion, where only the apical portion of the cell pinches off and releases products with some cytoplasm; the cell remains viable and continues secretion after partial loss.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Holocrine secretion involves the release of products through ion channels and carrier proteins in the plasma membrane, without vesicle involvement or cell damage; it\u2019s a rapid and regulated secretion mechanism.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Holocrine secretion involves the fusion of multiple cells to form a syncytium, which then releases a large amount of secretory product; the cells remain intact and continue secreting after product release."
