                        "goodAnswer": "Keratinization is a continuous process where keratinocytes, as they migrate from the stratum basale to the stratum corneum, accumulate keratin filaments, lose their nuclei and organelles, and become flattened, anucleate squames, ultimately forming a protective, water-resistant barrier crucial for skin's protective function.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Keratinization is a rapid process occurring only in response to injury, where melanocytes produce keratin to repair damaged skin; keratinocytes differentiate into melanocytes, and the skin becomes pigmented and temporarily thickened for enhanced protection against infection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Keratinization is a cyclical process initiated by Langerhans cells, which stimulate keratinocytes to synthesize melanin; the cells then migrate to the dermis, where they deposit keratin and contribute to skin elasticity and dermal strength rather than epidermal protection.",

                        "question": "Regarding hair follicles and hair growth, which of the following accurately describes the hair growth cycle stages (anagen, catagen, telogen), and the key events characterizing each stage?",
                        "goodAnswer": "The hair growth cycle includes: anagen (growth phase), characterized by active cell division in the hair bulb and follicle elongation; catagen (regression phase), a brief transitional phase with cessation of growth and follicle shrinkage; and telogen (resting phase), a period of follicle inactivity before a new anagen phase begins, leading to hair shedding and new hair growth.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The hair growth cycle consists of: prophase (initial growth), metaphase (mature growth), and telophase (shedding phase). Prophase involves rapid hair elongation, metaphase represents the longest phase of stable hair length, and telophase is a rapid shedding phase followed by follicle destruction and permanent hair loss.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Hair growth stages are: stratum basale (germinal layer), stratum spinosum (maturation layer), and stratum corneum (shedding layer). Stratum basale involves keratinocyte proliferation, stratum spinosum involves keratin accumulation, and stratum corneum represents the final keratinized hair shaft ready for shedding, with no cyclical follicle activity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The hair growth cycle includes: anaphase (growth and pigmentation), interphase (maintenance and lubrication), and cytokinesis (shedding and replacement). Anaphase involves melanin production and hair coloring, interphase involves sebum secretion and hair conditioning, and cytokinesis involves hair follicle splitting and regeneration from surrounding skin cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Hair growth stages are: follicular phase (growth initiation), luteal phase (growth maintenance), and menstrual phase (shedding and replacement). Follicular phase involves hormonal stimulation of hair growth, luteal phase involves hormonal stabilization of hair length, and menstrual phase involves cyclical hair shedding and hormonal resetting for new growth."

                        "goodAnswer": "The mammary gland is a modified apocrine sweat gland of the skin, developing from epidermal ridges and subcutaneous tissue. Structurally, it consists of lobes containing alveoli that secrete milk, organized into ducts converging at the nipple. Its primary function is lactation, producing and secreting milk to nourish newborns.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The mammary gland is a modified sebaceous gland of the skin, originating from dermal papillae and reticular dermis. Structurally, it comprises follicles that produce sebum-like milk, arranged in lobules draining into pores on the areola. Its primary function is sebum secretion for nipple lubrication and protection during breastfeeding.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The mammary gland is a modified eccrine sweat gland of the skin, developing from dermal sweat ducts and subcutaneous fat. Structurally, it consists of tubules that secrete watery milk, organized into networks converging at the areola. Its primary function is sweat production to cool the nipple during lactation and prevent overheating.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The mammary gland is a modified holocrine gland of the skin, originating from epidermal melanocytes and Langerhans cells. Structurally, it comprises vesicles that secrete melanin-rich milk, arranged in clusters draining into the nipple. Its primary function is milk pigmentation and immune protection for newborns through melanin transfer.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The mammary gland is a modified endocrine gland of the skin, developing from dermal fibroblasts and collagen fibers. Structurally, it consists of capsules that secrete hormone-rich milk, organized into layers converging at the nipple. Its primary function is hormone secretion to regulate newborn metabolism and growth via milk transfer."

                        "question": "Considering the functional stages of the mammary gland, which statement accurately outlines the differences between the inactive, lactating, and post-lactational states in terms of glandular structure and secretory activity?",
                        "goodAnswer": "In the inactive mammary gland, ducts are predominant with minimal alveolar development and no secretory activity. During lactation, alveoli proliferate extensively and become distended with milk, exhibiting active secretion. Post-lactationally, alveoli regress, ducts involute, and the gland returns to a predominantly inactive state, undergoing structural remodeling.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "In the inactive mammary gland, alveoli are fully developed and filled with milk, ready for secretion. During lactation, ducts proliferate and transport milk to the nipple, while alveoli remain structurally unchanged. Post-lactationally, alveoli enlarge further to store excess milk for future use, and ducts become more prominent for increased milk transport capacity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "In the inactive mammary gland, secretory cells are actively producing milk, but ducts are constricted, preventing secretion. During lactation, ducts dilate to allow milk flow, while alveolar secretion decreases. Post-lactationally, secretory cells continue to produce milk, but ducts become blocked, leading to milk accumulation and gland hypertrophy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "In the inactive mammary gland, glandular tissue is replaced by adipose tissue, with minimal ducts and alveoli. During lactation, adipose tissue is converted into secretory alveoli, while ducts disappear. Post-lactationally, secretory alveoli transform back into adipose tissue, and ducts regenerate for potential future lactation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "In the inactive mammary gland, ducts and alveoli are equally prominent and actively secrete a watery fluid. During lactation, ducts and alveoli shrink, and secretory activity ceases. Post-lactationally, ducts and alveoli disappear completely, and the gland becomes non-functional, requiring complete regeneration for future lactation."

                        "question": "Regarding milk production and secretion in the mammary gland, which of the following correctly describes the cellular mechanisms involved and the key components of breast milk?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Milk production involves merocrine secretion of protein components (e.g., casein, lactalbumin) and lactose, and apocrine secretion of lipid droplets by alveolar epithelial cells. Breast milk is a complex emulsion containing water, carbohydrates (lactose), proteins, lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids), vitamins, minerals, and immunoglobulins, providing complete nutrition and immune protection for infants.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Milk production involves holocrine secretion of all milk components, where entire alveolar cells are shed along with milk, resulting in a cellular debris-rich secretion. Breast milk primarily consists of cellular debris, keratin, melanin, and sebum, lacking significant nutritional components and immunoglobulins, mainly providing skin lubrication and pigmentation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Milk production involves eccrine secretion of watery components (water, electrolytes) and sebaceous secretion of lipid components by separate gland types within the mammary gland. Breast milk is a dilute solution of water, electrolytes, sebum, and sweat, lacking proteins, carbohydrates, and immunoglobulins, primarily for hydration and thermoregulation of infants.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Milk production involves paracrine secretion of hormonal components (e.g., prolactin, oxytocin) and endocrine secretion of metabolic components (e.g., glucose, amino acids) by stromal cells surrounding alveoli. Breast milk primarily contains hormones, growth factors, and metabolic regulators, lacking water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, mainly for hormonal signaling and metabolic control in infants.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Milk production involves transcellular transport of all milk components across alveolar epithelial cells without secretion mechanisms, resulting in a cell-free, homogeneous secretion. Breast milk is a simple solution of water and dissolved minerals, lacking complex organic molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and vitamins, primarily for hydration and mineral supplementation of infants."
