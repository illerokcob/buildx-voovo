                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Major 'complications of dermoid cysts' include hypercalcemia, paraneoplastic syndromes, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), necessitating clinical intervention and potentially chemotherapy to manage these systemic metabolic and hematologic derangements.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Major 'complications of dermoid cysts' include polycythemia, thrombocytosis, and leukemoid reaction, necessitating clinical intervention and potentially bone marrow transplantation to address these hematologic malignancies and cytopenias.",

                        "question": "What are 'mixed germ cell tumors' of the ovary and how do they impact prognosis and treatment strategies compared to pure germ cell tumor subtypes?",
                        "goodAnswer": "'Mixed germ cell tumors' contain more than one subtype of germ cell tumor components (e.g., teratoma + dysgerminoma + yolk sac tumor), potentially influencing prognosis and treatment strategies by requiring combination chemotherapy regimens effective against all constituent tumor types, and possibly indicating a more aggressive clinical course than pure subtypes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "'Mixed germ cell tumors' are a mixture of germ cell and epithelial tumor components (e.g., teratoma + serous cystadenocarcinoma), typically treated as epithelial ovarian cancers with cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, showing a prognosis similar to high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "'Mixed germ cell tumors' are a mixture of germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumor components (e.g., dysgerminoma + granulosa cell tumor), typically treated with hormonal therapy and targeted agents, showing a prognosis similar to sex cord-stromal tumors with hormonal responsiveness.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "'Mixed germ cell tumors' refer to germ cell tumors with both benign and malignant components within the same tumor mass (e.g., mature and immature teratoma), typically treated as benign tumors with conservative surgical management, showing an excellent prognosis similar to benign germ cell tumors.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "'Mixed germ cell tumors' are germ cell tumors that have metastasized to other organs (e.g., dysgerminoma with lung metastasis), typically treated with palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy, showing a poor prognosis similar to metastatic epithelial ovarian cancers."

                        "question": "How do sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary differ from both epithelial and germ cell tumors in terms of their cellular origin and typical clinical manifestations?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Sex cord-stromal tumors arise from the gonadal stroma and sex cords of the ovary, distinct from epithelial (surface epithelium) and germ cell (primordial germ cells) origins, often presenting with endocrine manifestations due to hormone production (estrogen or androgens), unlike typical epithelial or germ cell tumors.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Sex cord-stromal tumors arise from the ovarian surface epithelium, similar to epithelial tumors but distinct from germ cell tumors (primordial germ cells), often presenting with ascites and abdominal distension, similar to typical epithelial ovarian cancer presentations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Sex cord-stromal tumors arise from primordial germ cells, similar to germ cell tumors but distinct from epithelial tumors (surface epithelium), often presenting with rapid tumor growth and elevated tumor markers (AFP or hCG), similar to typical germ cell tumor presentations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Sex cord-stromal tumors and epithelial tumors share the same cellular origin from the ovarian surface epithelium, while germ cell tumors originate from primordial germ cells, both sex cord-stromal and epithelial tumors typically present with pelvic pain and abnormal vaginal bleeding.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Sex cord-stromal tumors and germ cell tumors share the same cellular origin from primordial germ cells, while epithelial tumors originate from the ovarian surface epithelium, both sex cord-stromal and germ cell tumors typically present with early-stage disease and favorable prognosis."

                        "goodAnswer": "Primary cancers most likely to 'metastasize to the ovary' include colorectal cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and endometrial cancer, typically involving bilateral ovarian involvement and a multinodular pattern on ovarian surface, often mimicking primary ovarian tumors but representing secondary ovarian malignancies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Primary cancers most likely to 'metastasize to the ovary' include leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and Hodgkin's disease, typically involving unilateral ovarian involvement and a cystic pattern within the ovarian stroma, often presenting as large solitary ovarian masses with hematologic malignancy history.",
