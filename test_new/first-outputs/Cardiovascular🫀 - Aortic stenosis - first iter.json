                        "question": "Which of the following statements accurately describes the primary etiological factor and the subsequent pathophysiological mechanism in the development of the disease, considering both genetic predisposition and environmental triggers?",
                        "goodAnswer": "The primary etiology involves a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, particularly mutations affecting genes crucial for immune regulation, compounded by environmental triggers such as viral infections or exposure to certain toxins, leading to an aberrant autoimmune response characterized by self-antigen targeting.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The main cause is solely attributed to environmental factors, specifically prolonged exposure to pollutants and allergens, which directly induce cellular damage and inflammation, bypassing any genetic predispositions and resulting in acute tissue injury rather than chronic autoimmune processes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Genetic factors are negligible in the etiology; instead, lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise are paramount. These directly modulate the inflammatory response, leading to the disease through metabolic dysregulation and systemic inflammation without a significant autoimmune component.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The disease is primarily caused by bacterial infections that trigger a direct cytotoxic effect on target organs. Genetic predisposition plays a minor role, mainly influencing the severity of the acute infectious phase but not contributing to chronic autoimmune pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Pathophysiology is initiated by psychological stress, which is the dominant etiological factor. Stress hormones directly suppress the immune system, paradoxically leading to an overreaction and subsequent autoimmune attack on self-tissues, independent of genetic or environmental factors."

                        "question": "In the context of the disease's pathogenesis, identify the most critical cellular component and the corresponding molecular pathway that are initially dysregulated, leading to the cascade of inflammatory events and tissue damage.",
                        "goodAnswer": "The initiation of pathogenesis is critically dependent on the dysregulation of T helper cells, specifically the Th17 subtype, and their excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and TNF-alpha, which activate downstream pathways involving NF-\u03baB and JAK-STAT, thereby promoting chronic inflammation and tissue destruction.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The primary cellular component is the neutrophil, which, upon activation by complement factors, releases excessive reactive oxygen species and lysosomal enzymes, directly causing tissue necrosis and initiating inflammation independently of T cell involvement or cytokine signaling.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Macrophages are the central cells in pathogenesis, primarily through their role in phagocytosis of cellular debris and release of growth factors like TGF-\u03b2, leading to fibrosis and tissue remodeling as the main pathological consequences, with minimal involvement of T helper cell cytokines.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "B lymphocytes are the key cellular component, with their aberrant production of autoantibodies directed against self-antigens, leading to immune complex deposition and subsequent activation of the classical complement pathway, causing inflammation and tissue damage without significant T cell mediation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Natural killer (NK) cells are the primary drivers of pathogenesis, as they directly target and lyse healthy cells expressing stress ligands, initiating tissue injury and releasing chemokines that attract other immune cells, thereby propagating inflammation, independent of adaptive immune responses or cytokine networks."

                        "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of genetic factors in predisposing individuals to the disease, considering specific gene loci and their functional implications in immune system regulation?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Genetic predisposition involves multiple gene loci, notably within the HLA region, particularly HLA-DRB1 alleles, which are associated with altered antigen presentation and increased susceptibility. Polymorphisms in non-HLA genes, such as PTPN22 and STAT4, further contribute by influencing T cell receptor signaling and cytokine production, thus modulating immune tolerance and reactivity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Genetic factors are limited to single gene mutations with high penetrance, primarily affecting genes involved in structural proteins of the target organ, leading to inherent organ vulnerability and disease development irrespective of immune system function or HLA variations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary genetic influence is through mitochondrial DNA mutations, which impair cellular energy production and increase oxidative stress, making cells more susceptible to inflammatory damage, independent of specific HLA alleles or immune regulatory genes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Genetic susceptibility is solely determined by variations in genes encoding complement components, leading to either excessive or deficient complement activation, which directly mediates tissue damage without significant contribution from HLA or T cell signaling genes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Genetic predisposition is largely polygenic, involving a broad spectrum of genes related to general cellular stress response and DNA repair mechanisms, rather than specific immune regulatory genes or HLA alleles, making individuals universally susceptible to environmental triggers."

                        "goodAnswer": "Major criteria indicative of severe disease include the presence of lupus nephritis, particularly proliferative glomerulonephritis (Class III or IV), which signifies significant renal involvement and is associated with increased risk of end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular complications.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Mild mucocutaneous manifestations, such as oral ulcers and discoid rash, are considered major criteria, indicating severe disease activity and a high risk of systemic progression and organ damage, particularly renal and neurological involvement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Isolated thrombocytopenia with platelet counts between 100,000-150,000/\u03bcL, without other cytopenias or bleeding manifestations, is a major criterion, indicating severe bone marrow suppression and a high likelihood of developing life-threatening infections.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mild pericarditis, characterized by chest pain and a pericardial friction rub on auscultation, without evidence of tamponade or hemodynamic compromise, is classified as a major criterion, signifying severe cardiac involvement and a poor prognosis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Presence of alopecia and Raynaud's phenomenon, although common, are considered major criteria, reflecting severe systemic disease activity and predicting a high likelihood of developing irreversible organ damage, especially in the lungs and liver."

                        "goodAnswer": "Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is characterized by skin-limited disease with lesions such as discoid lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus, and acute cutaneous lupus (including malar rash), typically without major systemic organ involvement, whereas systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) involves multisystem disease with potential for renal, neurological, hematological, and serosal involvement in addition to cutaneous manifestations.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Both cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) invariably present with severe systemic involvement, including lupus nephritis and central nervous system manifestations, with the primary difference being the morphology of skin lesions; CLE showing bullous lesions and SLE presenting with maculopapular rashes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is exclusively a skin disease, characterized by extensive cutaneous lesions across the body, including mucosal involvement, while cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is defined by systemic involvement, particularly affecting the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, but typically sparing the skin.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is defined by acute onset of severe multisystem disease, mimicking septic shock with fever, hypotension, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereas systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with chronic, localized skin lesions, primarily affecting sun-exposed areas and sparing internal organs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The distinction lies in the autoantibody profile; cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies and low complement levels, indicating systemic immune activation, while systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and normal complement, suggesting skin-limited immune dysregulation."

                        "goodAnswer": "Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test by indirect immunofluorescence is highly sensitive for screening, often positive in >95% of cases, but has low specificity as it can be positive in other autoimmune diseases, infections, and even in healthy individuals, necessitating further specific antibody testing for confirmation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody test is the most sensitive screening test, with near 100% positivity in all patients and high specificity for differentiating the disease from other autoimmune conditions due to its direct association with the pathogenic mechanism.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Complement levels (C3 and C4) are the most sensitive screening markers, showing consistent depression in early disease stages and high specificity for differentiating it from conditions with normal complement levels, thus serving as a definitive diagnostic tool.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the most sensitive initial screening test, always elevated in active disease and highly specific due to its direct correlation with inflammatory burden, effectively distinguishing it from non-inflammatory conditions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibody test is the most sensitive screening test, positive in virtually all cases and exceptionally specific, making it the gold standard for initial diagnosis and differentiation from other autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorders."

                        "goodAnswer": "For severe disease, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) are often used; MMF inhibits purine synthesis, suppressing lymphocyte proliferation, crucial for lupus nephritis; CYC is an alkylating agent, broadly suppressing immune cells, used for severe flares and organ-threatening disease. Biologics like belimumab (anti-BAFF) and rituximab (anti-CD20) are also used for refractory cases, targeting B-cell activation and depletion respectively.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Severe cases are primarily managed with high-dose methotrexate (MTX) and azathioprine (AZA); MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, reducing cell proliferation, while AZA is a purine analog, interfering with DNA synthesis, both mainly targeting T-cell mediated inflammation and effective for long-term maintenance but less so for acute severe flares.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "First-line agents for severe disease are cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (TAC); both are calcineurin inhibitors, blocking IL-2 production and T-cell activation, primarily used for acute control of inflammation and organ involvement, but limited by nephrotoxicity and hypertension, making them unsuitable for long-term use.",

Dietary modifications, stress management, and vaccination are also important supportive measures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Non-pharmacological strategies are limited to complete bed rest during active flares to minimize joint stress and promote healing, a high-protein diet to counteract muscle wasting, and avoidance of all physical activity to prevent exacerbation of symptoms, with minimal emphasis on psychosocial support or lifestyle modifications.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Management primarily involves aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy to restore joint function and mobility, regardless of disease activity, along with high-dose vitamin D supplementation to boost immune function and prevent osteoporosis, and strict adherence to a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation, with limited consideration for sun protection or psychological well-being.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Non-pharmacological approaches focus on complete avoidance of all medications to minimize side effects, rigorous fasting and detoxification regimens to cleanse the body of toxins, and spiritual healing practices to address the underlying cause of the disease, with minimal emphasis on evidence-based lifestyle modifications or supportive medical care.",
