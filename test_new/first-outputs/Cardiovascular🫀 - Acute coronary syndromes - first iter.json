                        "goodAnswer": "Elevated levels of cardiac troponin at discharge or during follow-up indicate ongoing myocardial necrosis or injury, signifying a higher risk of future cardiovascular events and need for intensified therapy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Normal levels of cardiac troponin at discharge guarantee a low risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, eliminating the need for further risk stratification and aggressive secondary prevention measures post-ACS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Decreasing levels of cardiac troponin during hospitalization indicate worsening myocardial damage and a higher risk of adverse outcomes, requiring more aggressive interventions and prolonged monitoring post-ACS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Fluctuating levels of cardiac troponin during follow-up are indicative of unstable plaque and high risk of recurrent ACS, mandating urgent repeat angiography and revascularization procedures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Baseline levels of cardiac troponin prior to ACS event are the most important predictors of long-term cardiovascular risk and should guide post-ACS risk stratification and treatment strategies."

                        "goodAnswer": "Stress testing (exercise or pharmacological), including ECG stress test, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging, is frequently used to detect residual ischemia and guide further management post-ACS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the primary non-invasive test used for post-ACS risk stratification to assess for nocturnal hypertension and guide antihypertensive therapy adjustments.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Pulmonary function testing is routinely performed for post-ACS risk stratification to evaluate for underlying respiratory conditions and predict long-term cardiovascular outcomes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common non-invasive test used in post-ACS risk stratification to assess for neurological complications and predict the risk of stroke after ACS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Renal function tests, including serum creatinine and eGFR, are the most important non-invasive tests for post-ACS risk stratification to determine the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy during angiography."
