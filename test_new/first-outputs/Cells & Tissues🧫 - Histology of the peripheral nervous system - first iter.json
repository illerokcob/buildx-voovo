                        "question": "How do neuromuscular spindles contribute to the regulation of muscle tone and posture through the stretch reflex pathway?",
                        "goodAnswer": "Spindle activation by muscle stretch leads to increased firing of sensory neurons, which monosynaptically excite alpha motor neurons, causing the stretched muscle to contract and maintain tone/posture.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Spindle activation by muscle stretch leads to decreased firing of sensory neurons, which inhibit alpha motor neurons, causing the stretched muscle to relax and reduce muscle tone.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Spindle activation by muscle stretch leads to activation of gamma motor neurons, which cause intrafusal muscle fibers to contract, increasing spindle sensitivity but not directly affecting muscle tone.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Spindle activation by muscle stretch leads to polysynaptic inhibition of alpha motor neurons and excitation of antagonist muscle motor neurons, resulting in reciprocal inhibition and coordinated movement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Spindle activation by muscle stretch leads to release of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord that directly inhibit muscle contraction and promote muscle relaxation, independent of motor neuron activity."
