                        "goodAnswer": "Minor calyces initiate urine collection directly from the renal papillae of each renal pyramid, and subsequently, several minor calyces converge and unite to form major calyces, which then ultimately drain into the renal pelvis, effectively funneling urine towards the ureter for excretion.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Major calyces are the primary structures that collect urine immediately from the renal papillae, and these major calyces then converge to form minor calyces, which subsequently empty into the renal pelvis before the urine is transported into the ureter, reversing the flow sequence.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Renal papillae directly channel urine into the major calyces, which then combine to form minor calyces, ultimately leading to the renal pelvis and subsequently to the ureter for urine excretion, indicating a convergence from larger to smaller collecting units.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Minor calyces are large, expansive collecting chambers that receive urine from multiple renal pyramids simultaneously, and these then drain into smaller major calyces, which finally lead to the renal pelvis and the ureter, suggesting a scale-down in size during urine progression.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The renal corpuscle is structurally composed of the glomerulus, which is a specialized network of capillaries responsible for blood filtration, and Bowman's capsule, a double-layered epithelial cup that encapsulates the glomerulus, featuring parietal and visceral layers; the visceral layer contains podocytes that intricately enhance the filtration process.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Cortical nephrons are predominantly located within the renal cortex, characterized by short loops of Henle that barely extend into the outer renal medulla, whereas juxtamedullary nephrons are distinguished by having glomeruli situated near the corticomedullary junction and possessing long loops of Henle that extend deeply into the inner medulla, which is critically important for urine concentration mechanisms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Cortical nephrons are found extensively throughout the renal medulla, characterized by long loops of Henle that reach into the cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are located superficially within the cortex with short loops that are confined to the outer cortex, playing only a minor role in urine concentration and primarily involved in cortical functions.",

                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Both cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons are evenly distributed between the renal cortex and medulla, with cortical nephrons having comparatively longer loops of Henle than juxtamedullary nephrons, and both nephron types contribute equally to both urine concentration and dilution processes throughout the kidney.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Juxtamedullary nephrons are mainly located in the renal cortex, possessing long loops of Henle that extend far into the outer medulla, and cortical nephrons are found closer to the medulla with short loops that are limited to the inner cortex, primarily involved in reabsorption processes but not significantly in urine concentration mechanisms."

                        "goodAnswer": "The PCT is histologically lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium that is uniquely characterized by a prominent brush border of dense microvilli at its apical surface, significantly increasing the surface area available for reabsorption, and its primary function is to reabsorb the majority of filtered water, essential ions, and vital nutrients from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The PCT is lined by a simple squamous epithelium that features cilia along its apical surface, enhancing the movement of fluid along the tubule lumen, and its primary function is the active secretion of waste products and toxins into the tubular fluid, with minimal reabsorption of nutrients occurring in this segment of the nephron.",

                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The loop of Henle is lined by a simple columnar epithelium that contains goblet cells which secrete mucus to protect the epithelial lining from osmotic stress, and its primary function is to concentrate urine by actively transporting solutes out of the tubular fluid into the medullary interstitium, contrasting with PCT's reabsorptive role.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The PCT is lined by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that includes a thick glycocalyx layer on its apical surface, which primarily functions to protect the cells from toxins present in the filtrate, and its primary role is to filter blood plasma and actively prevent the reabsorption of proteins back into the bloodstream, focusing on filtration rather than reabsorption."

                        "goodAnswer": "The descending limb of the loop of Henle is characterized by its high permeability to water but limited permeability to solutes, thereby primarily facilitating water reabsorption from the tubular fluid into the interstitium, while the thin ascending limb exhibits permeability to solutes but not to water, allowing for passive solute reabsorption, and the thick ascending limb actively transports sodium chloride (NaCl) out of the filtrate, further contributing to the osmotic gradient.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Both the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle are characterized by equal permeability to both water and solutes, facilitating the simultaneous reabsorption and secretion of both types of substances, which maintains isotonic conditions throughout the loop and does not contribute to urine concentration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to solutes but impermeable to water, leading to an increase in solute concentration within the tubular fluid as it descends, whereas the ascending limb is permeable to water but not to solutes, causing dilution of the tubular fluid as water is reabsorbed, reversing the actual permeability roles.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The descending limb of the loop of Henle actively transports water out of the filtrate, making it effectively impermeable to solutes, while the ascending limb actively transports solutes into the filtrate and is impermeable to water, resulting in the concentration of urine within the descending limb and dilution in the ascending limb, misrepresenting the transport mechanisms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Both the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle are impermeable to both water and solutes, functioning primarily as structural conduits for the movement of tubular fluid without any significant reabsorption or secretion processes occurring within these segments, negating their functional roles in concentration and dilution."

                        "goodAnswer": "The DCT and collecting duct are both lined by simple cuboidal epithelium, though the DCT has fewer microvilli compared to the PCT, and they are functionally involved in the hormonally regulated reabsorption of sodium and water, primarily by aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) respectively, as well as the secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions, playing a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte and acid-base balance in the body.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The DCT and collecting duct are lined by a stratified squamous epithelium that possesses a dense brush border, and they are primarily involved in the active secretion of large proteins and glucose into the urine, being largely unresponsive to hormonal regulation and focusing on excretion rather than regulated reabsorption.",

                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The DCT and loop of Henle are lined by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium and are mainly involved in the passive diffusion of water and solutes, with hormonal control primarily regulating blood flow to the glomerulus rather than directly modulating tubular reabsorption processes in the DCT or loop of Henle.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The PCT and DCT are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium that contains numerous goblet cells, secreting mucus to protect the epithelial lining, and they are primarily involved in the initial filtration and formation of urine, with minimal hormonal influence on their function beyond basic filtration rate adjustments."
