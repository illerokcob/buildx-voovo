                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The mesentery proper is a single layer of peritoneum that suspends the colon and rectum from the anterior abdominal wall. It contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves supplying the large intestine, facilitating absorption and support.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The mesentery proper is a double layer of peritoneum that suspends the duodenum and jejunum from the anterior abdominal wall. It contains bile ducts, lymphatic vessels, and nerves supplying the small intestine, facilitating digestion and support.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The mesentery proper is a single layer of peritoneum that suspends the jejunum and ileum from the posterior thoracic wall. It contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves supplying the small intestine, hindering motility and support.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The mesentery proper is a double layer of peritoneum that suspends the stomach and duodenum from the posterior abdominal wall. It contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves supplying the stomach, facilitating motility and support."
