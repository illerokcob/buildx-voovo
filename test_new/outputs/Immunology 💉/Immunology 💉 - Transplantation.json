                        "goodAnswer": "ABO matching is critical because pre-existing IgM and IgG antibodies against A and B antigens can cause immediate complement activation and hyperacute rejection of ABO-incompatible grafts, leading to rapid vascular thrombosis.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Acute GVHD typically manifests within the first 100 days post-HSCT, predominantly targeting the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, primarily mediated by donor T-cell recognition of recipient HLA mismatches and direct cytotoxicity; chronic GVHD develops beyond 100 days, affecting multiple organs with features of fibrosis and autoimmunity, involving both cellular and humoral immunity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Acute GVHD generally develops months to years after transplantation, primarily affecting the lungs and kidneys, and is characterized by antibody-mediated rejection of the graft and vascular damage; chronic GVHD occurs early post-transplant, mainly targeting the heart and central nervous system, mediated by natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and cytokine storm.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Acute GVHD is predominantly a B-cell mediated complication, typically occurring late post-transplant and affecting the bone marrow and lymph nodes, leading to graft failure and pancytopenia; chronic GVHD is an early T-cell mediated condition targeting endocrine glands and skeletal muscles, resulting in immune deficiency and muscle wasting.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Acute GVHD is characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of the transplanted organ, typically observed in solid organ transplants and occurring years after transplantation; chronic GVHD is an early complication specifically in HSCT, marked by acute rejection episodes and vascular endothelial damage in the graft.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Acute GVHD is primarily mediated by recipient T-cell responses against donor antigens, leading to graft rejection within the first few weeks post-transplant; chronic GVHD is predominantly caused by donor B-cell responses against recipient antigens, resulting in late-onset antibody-mediated rejection and graft dysfunction."

                        "goodAnswer": "Bacterial and fungal infections, notably invasive fungal infections such as Aspergillus and Candida species, along with bacterial infections from Gram-positive (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) and Gram-negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae), are major concerns during early post-HSCT neutropenia.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Viral infections, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, represent the most prevalent infections in the early post-HSCT period, typically occurring within the first 30 days and frequently causing severe pneumonia, hepatitis, and lymphoproliferative disorders.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Parasitic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis, are the primary infectious complications in the early post-HSCT phase, requiring routine prophylactic measures and preemptive therapeutic strategies to prevent severe morbidity and mortality.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Mycobacterial infections, encompassing tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), are the most frequent infections in the early post-HSCT period, often presenting with disseminated disease patterns and requiring prolonged multi-drug antibiotic treatment regimens.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Protozoal infections, such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia, are the most common infections in the early post-HSCT phase, frequently causing severe and refractory diarrhea and malabsorption syndromes, particularly in patients concurrently experiencing graft-versus-host disease."

                        "goodAnswer": "VOD/SOS is a hepatic complication characterized by injury and activation of sinusoidal endothelial cells, leading to sinusoidal obstruction, intrahepatic venule occlusion, and subsequent hepatomegaly, jaundice, and fluid retention; major risk factors include high-dose busulfan-based conditioning, pre-existing liver disease, and allogeneic HSCT.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "VOD/SOS is primarily a pulmonary complication marked by alveolar capillary leak and diffuse alveolar damage, culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure; established risk factors include total body irradiation-based conditioning, high-dose cyclophosphamide administration, and autologous HSCT.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "VOD/SOS is a renal complication characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy and acute kidney injury secondary to endothelial damage, leading to oliguria, azotemia, and electrolyte imbalances; key risk factors include calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression, acute graft-versus-host disease, and unrelated donor HSCT.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "VOD/SOS is a cardiac complication characterized by pericardial effusion, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure and arrhythmias; major risk factors include anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, pre-existing cardiac conditions, and HLA-DRB1 allele mismatches in donor-recipient pairs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "VOD/SOS is a neurological complication characterized by cerebral edema, seizures, and encephalopathy due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier and neurotoxicity; established risk factors include cyclosporine and tacrolimus neurotoxicity, cord blood transplantation in pediatric recipients, and pre-existing neurological disorders."
