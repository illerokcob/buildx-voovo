                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Complete and immediate cessation of glucocorticoids is the most effective withdrawal strategy, as it abruptly forces the HPA axis to resume function and quickly eliminates the risk of long-term side effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Glucocorticoid withdrawal should be accompanied by high-dose mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for potential adrenal insufficiency and maintain electrolyte balance during the tapering process."

                        "goodAnswer": "Glucocorticoid replacement therapy involves administering physiological doses of hydrocortisone or similar agents, typically divided doses to mimic diurnal cortisol rhythm, with monitoring of clinical symptoms and sometimes ACTH levels to adjust dosage and minimize over- or under-replacement.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency requires high doses of long-acting glucocorticoids like dexamethasone, administered once daily to ensure sustained suppression of ACTH secretion and prevent adrenal crisis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Glucocorticoid replacement should be initiated with a loading dose followed by a fixed, low maintenance dose of prednisone, without the need for dose adjustments based on clinical response or ACTH levels.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Replacement therapy involves administering supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids to compensate for the impaired adrenal function and ensure adequate anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, monitored primarily by blood glucose levels.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Glucocorticoid replacement therapy is best managed with intermittent, pulse dosing of high-potency glucocorticoids to stimulate adrenal gland recovery and gradually wean off exogenous glucocorticoids, monitored by serum electrolyte levels."

                        "goodAnswer": "Anti-cytokine agents work by selectively targeting specific cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6) or their receptors, thereby modulating inflammatory pathways and reducing immune-mediated tissue damage in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Anti-cytokine agents broadly suppress the entire immune system by depleting immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, leading to a general reduction in immune responses and inflammation across various diseases.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "These agents primarily function by enhancing the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), promoting immune tolerance and suppressing excessive immune responses in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Anti-cytokine drugs work by directly inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, similar to NSAIDs, but with greater specificity for inflammatory cytokines and fewer systemic side effects.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The main mechanism of action involves the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that counteract inflammatory signals, indirectly reducing cytokine production and their downstream effects in target tissues."

                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Major classes of anti-cytokine agents are glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone), calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus), broadly suppressing immune cell activation and proliferation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The main classes include antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, loratadine), leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g., montelukast, zafirlukast), and mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn), primarily targeting allergic and mast cell-mediated inflammation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Major classes are non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate and sulfasalazine, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib), broadly modulating inflammatory and immune responses."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors are primarily used to treat acute bacterial infections and sepsis by neutralizing TNF-\u03b1's pro-inflammatory effects, effectively controlling systemic inflammatory response and improving patient outcomes, with minimal side effects.",
