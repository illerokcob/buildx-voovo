                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Resistance can be mediated by the production of target mimic proteins that bind to fluoroquinolones, sequestering the drug and preventing it from reaching its primary targets, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, within the bacterial cell, effectively neutralizing the antibiotic and conferring resistance through target protection."

                        "goodAnswer": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs aim to optimize antimicrobial use to improve patient outcomes by ensuring appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of therapy, reduce antimicrobial resistance development and spread, and minimize adverse drug events and healthcare costs through interventions like formulary restrictions, prospective audit and feedback, and de-escalation strategies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Antimicrobial stewardship primarily focuses on accelerating the development and approval of novel antimicrobial agents to combat emerging resistance threats and ensure a robust pipeline of new antibiotics, irrespective of current usage patterns and resistance prevention strategies in clinical practice.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs are mainly directed at reducing the financial burden of antimicrobial therapy on healthcare systems by promoting the use of the least expensive generic antibiotics and restricting access to newer, more costly agents, regardless of their clinical appropriateness or impact on resistance selection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Antimicrobial stewardship is centered on ensuring unrestricted access to the broadest possible range of antimicrobial agents for all patients to maximize treatment options and patient choice, without specific emphasis on optimizing prescribing practices or addressing antimicrobial resistance concerns beyond infection control measures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Antimicrobial stewardship mainly focuses on implementing stringent infection control measures, such as isolation protocols and enhanced hygiene practices, to prevent the transmission of resistant organisms within healthcare facilities, with minimal emphasis on modifying antimicrobial prescribing behaviors or optimizing antibiotic selection and duration."

                        "goodAnswer": "Selective pressure, in the context of antimicrobial resistance, refers to the evolutionary process whereby the use of antimicrobial agents creates an environment that favors the survival and proliferation of microorganisms with pre-existing or acquired resistance mechanisms, while inhibiting or eliminating susceptible organisms, leading to an increased proportion of resistant strains in the microbial population over time.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Selective pressure describes the direct cytotoxic effects of antimicrobial agents on mammalian host cells, leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction, which indirectly promotes the emergence of resistant microorganisms by weakening the host's immune defenses and creating niches for resistant pathogens to colonize.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Selective pressure refers to the pressure exerted by the host's immune system on microbial pathogens, driving them to develop resistance mechanisms to evade immune clearance, independent of antimicrobial agent use, as part of the natural host-pathogen co-evolutionary dynamics and immune escape mechanisms.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Selective pressure is the environmental stress imposed on microbial populations by factors such as temperature fluctuations, nutrient limitation, and pH changes, leading to genetic mutations and the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents as a general adaptation to adverse environmental conditions, irrespective of drug exposure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Selective pressure describes the competitive interactions between different microbial species within a polymicrobial community, where resistant species gain a competitive advantage over susceptible species in the presence of antimicrobial agents, leading to a shift in microbial community composition towards dominance of resistant populations."

                        "goodAnswer": "Diagnostic stewardship involves promoting the use of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests, such as molecular diagnostics and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, to identify the causative pathogen, guide targeted antimicrobial therapy, narrow antibiotic spectra, and de-escalate empiric therapy, thereby reducing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use and limiting selective pressure for resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Diagnostic stewardship focuses on restricting access to diagnostic testing to reduce healthcare costs and promote empirical antimicrobial therapy based solely on clinical presentation and local epidemiological data, without specific pathogen identification, to streamline clinical workflows and minimize laboratory resource utilization.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Diagnostic stewardship emphasizes the routine use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents as first-line therapy for most infections to ensure prompt and effective treatment coverage while awaiting diagnostic results, thereby minimizing the risk of treatment failure and improving patient outcomes, regardless of potential resistance implications.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Diagnostic stewardship promotes the development of novel diagnostic tests that can predict individual patient responses to specific antimicrobial agents based on host genetic markers and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, rather than focusing on pathogen identification or susceptibility testing, to personalize antimicrobial therapy.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Diagnostic stewardship encourages the widespread use of over-the-counter antimicrobial agents for self-treatment of infections to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and empower patients to manage their own health, without relying on laboratory diagnostics or prescription requirements, to improve access to care and reduce healthcare expenditures."

                        "goodAnswer": "Target site modification involves genetic mutations in bacterial genes encoding the antibiotic target molecule, such as ribosomes, penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), or DNA gyrase, leading to structural alterations in the target site that reduce the binding affinity of the antibiotic, thus diminishing its inhibitory effect and conferring resistance, even when the antibiotic reaches its intracellular target.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, as a resistance mechanism, involves bacterial enzymes that degrade or chemically modify the antibiotic molecule itself, rendering it inactive before it can reach its target site, thereby preventing its antimicrobial action and conferring resistance through drug inactivation, not target alteration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Efflux pumps, as a resistance mechanism, actively transport antibiotics out of the bacterial cell, maintaining a low intracellular concentration of the drug and preventing it from reaching effective levels at its target site, thus reducing antibiotic efficacy and conferring resistance through drug removal, not target modification.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Reduced cell permeability, as a resistance mechanism, involves alterations in the bacterial cell wall or membrane that decrease the uptake of antibiotics into the cell, limiting the amount of drug that can reach its intracellular target and reducing antibiotic effectiveness, conferring resistance through decreased drug entry, not target alteration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Bypass pathways, as a resistance mechanism, involve bacteria developing alternative metabolic pathways that circumvent the pathway inhibited by the antibiotic, allowing them to survive and grow despite the presence of the drug, thus conferring resistance through metabolic adaptation, not target site modification."
