                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Isolated ST-segment depression on resting ECG, well-controlled hypertension, mild stable angina only with high-intensity exertion, and sinus bradycardia are considered high-risk features necessitating intensive post-ACS management.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Elevated levels of cardiac troponin measured at discharge or during follow-up indicate ongoing myocardial necrosis or injury, signifying a heightened risk of future cardiovascular events and necessitating intensification of secondary prevention therapies.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Normal levels of cardiac troponin at hospital discharge confidently exclude any significant residual myocardial damage and guarantee a low risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, obviating the need for further risk stratification or aggressive secondary prevention post-ACS.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Consistently decreasing levels of cardiac troponin during hospitalization post-ACS indicate worsening myocardial damage and a paradoxically increased risk of adverse outcomes, requiring more aggressive interventions and prolonged inpatient monitoring.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Fluctuating levels of cardiac troponin during outpatient follow-up post-ACS are indicative of unstable atherosclerotic plaque and an acutely high risk of recurrent ACS events, mandating urgent repeat coronary angiography and revascularization procedures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Baseline levels of cardiac troponin measured prior to the ACS event are the most critical predictors of long-term cardiovascular risk and should be the primary determinant guiding post-ACS risk stratification and subsequent treatment strategies."

                        "goodAnswer": "Stress testing, encompassing exercise or pharmacological stress ECG, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging, is frequently utilized post-ACS to detect residual myocardial ischemia and guide decisions regarding further invasive procedures or medical therapy optimization.",
