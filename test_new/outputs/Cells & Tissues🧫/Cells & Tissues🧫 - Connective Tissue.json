                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Reticular connective tissue proper is characterized by elastic fibers arranged in branching networks produced by fibroblasts, along with fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells; it functions to provide elasticity and recoil in arterial walls and lungs, primarily located in arterial walls, vocal cords, and elastic ligaments.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Reticular connective tissue proper is characterized by adipocytes filled with lipid droplets produced by adipoblasts, along with adipocytes and blood vessels; it functions to store energy reserves and provide insulation in subcutaneous tissue and around organs, primarily located in subcutaneous tissue, mesenteries, and omentum.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Reticular connective tissue proper is characterized by chondrocytes embedded in a cartilaginous matrix produced by chondroblasts, along with chondrocytes and perichondrium; it functions to provide flexible support and shock absorption in articular surfaces and ears, primarily located in articular cartilage, ears, nose, and trachea.",
